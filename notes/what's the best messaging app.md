title: what's the best messaging app
tags: privacy, software
---

Recently some of my friend group wanted to move messaging app. We were using Instagram. For me this was a great opportunity to promote the good word of ~~God~~ encryption and privacy, and also make a proto-comparison matrix of different apps, as every comparison matrix is biased, usually to whoever's website you're on. In this case, I provide the bias.

Instagram is only on the list because this was a proposal to move away from Instagram, and WhatsApp is only there because everyone I personally know whines and says "but eeeveryone has WhatsApp". Currently, I'm mostly using Telegram and Signal to message people.

The list of features is just from me imagining what I want, what I've experienced before, and clicking around on various apps and seeing what they have (e.g., Signal's story feature - does *anyone* use this???)

key:

- Instagram 📸
- whatsapp 🟩
- telegram 🚙
- signal 👁️‍🗨️

features:

† only for short time
‡ yea but it looks super annoying

options not considered here, for a multitude of reasons (feel free to guess why):

- messenger
- SMS
- IRC
- Matrix
- Discord
- Jabber/XMPP
- Skype
- Snapchat
- Kik
- WeChat
- Viber
- Slack
- Teams
- ones I found while googling that I've not heard of

We ended up moving to Signal.

P.S., it is possible that I have a Western bias against Telegram, I enjoyed this podcast about Signal but it did feel that some of the criticisms were just "it's not an app controlled by the USA": <https://logbuch-netzpolitik.de/lnp504-the-politics-of-intellectual-shame>
