I am a director of [Sheffield Hackspace](https://www.sheffieldhackspace.org.uk/) and part of my role is to keep track of the membership.

It's currently via a spreadsheet where the membership payments come via bank transactions, and I match them up to the sheet. This involves a lot of finding names with "CTRL+F", and then changing a specific column.

I'd like to be able to "jump to column N", but I couldn't find an appropriate shortcut (I would love something like "Alt" then press "N", but alas).

After some web-searching, I found [AutoKey](https://github.com/autokey/autokey), a Linux program that sounds like a colder version of [AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/). I installed it, and it worked great. I'd tried to use `xdotool` to send key commands before, but it didn't work when set as a keyboard shortcut.

What I wanted to do using the keyboard was:

- open the cell "Name Box" (the bit that says "A59" or "H14")
- change the first letter to an "N" (i.e., turn "A57" into "N57")
- press Enter to go to that cell

After reading the the [documentation](https://autokey.github.io/api.html), I figured a script to do this:

```bash
import time
keyboard.send_keys("<ctrl>+<shift>+T")
time.sleep(0.25)
keyboard.send_keys("<left>")
keyboard.send_keys("<shift>+N")
keyboard.send_key("<delete>")
keyboard.send_key("<enter>")
```

(the 0.25 second wait is to let LibreOffice Calc recognise the shortcut and move the cursor to the Name Box)

â€¦and used the GUI to set the script to run whenever I typed "Ctrl+F8".

It worked great :]

I see myself using this program more into the future.
