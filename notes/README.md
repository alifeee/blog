# notes

here is my sub-blog for notes, which is effectively the same as my blog but for shorter, less well-written posts.

unlike my blog, which is raw HTML, this uses a static site builder - eleventy - so that I can publish a note from anywhere by dropping a markdown file into the GitHub repository.
