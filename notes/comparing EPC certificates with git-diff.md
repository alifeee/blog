Our house just got a new EPC certificate. You can (maybe) check yours on <https://www.gov.uk/find-energy-certificate>.

I'm interested in easy ways to see change. Trying to compare the old and new webpages by eye is hard, which leads me to text-diffing. I can copy the contents of the website to a file and compare them that way. Let's. I did a similar thing a while ago [with computer benchmarks](https://blog.alifeee.co.uk/notes/comparing-pcs-with-terminal-commands/).

I manually create two files by copying the interesting bits of the webpage, called `1` and `2` (because who has time for `.txt` extensions). Then, I can run:

```bash
git diff --no-index -U1000 ~/1 ~/2 > diff.txt
cat diff.txt | sed -E 's#^\+(.*)#<ins>\1</ins>#' | sed -E 's#^-(.*)#<del>\1</del>#' | sed 's/^ //'
```

The latter command turns each into HTML by turning `+` lines into `<ins>` ("insert"), `-` into `<del>` ("delete"), and removing leading spaces on other lines. Then, I can whack the output into a simple HTML template:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <style>
    body { background: black; color: white; }
    pre { padding: 1rem; }
    del { text-decoration: none; color: red; }
    ins { text-decoration: none; color: green; }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
<pre>
diff goes here...
<del>del lines will be red</del>
<ins>ins lines will be green</ins>
</pre>
  </body>
</html>
```

The final output is something like this (personal information removed. don't doxx me.)

<div id="comparing-pcs-diff-section">
<style>
#comparing-pcs-diff-section > pre {background: black;color: white;}
#comparing-pcs-diff-section del {text-decoration: none;color: red;}
#comparing-pcs-diff-section ins {color: green;text-decoration: none;}
</style>

Good job on us for having 100% low energy lighting fixtures, I guess...

Really, this is a complicated way to simplify something. I like simple things, so I like this.
