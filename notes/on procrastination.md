a while ago (maybe an hour), I opened my to-do list. Here is the tale that follows of the resulting procrastination. Too much in life it is possible to convince yourself that everyone else is more organised than you because you only see the final product. So, this is one miniature combat against that idea.

I opened obsidian  
on my todo list it said "make a christmas list"  
I thought I had made one before, so I looked in my "resource" folder  
I found a hitchhiking list  
it didn't have my latest hitchhike on there, so I added it  
at the same time, I hadn't edited the page since I exported it from Notion, so it was badly formatted  
I fixed the formatting, and while doing so remembered...  
I have a note on my phone about the people I've met hitching (this note was only about the service stations visited)  
I opened my notes app to find it  
I found a note about android keyboards from when I switched keyboard  
I wanted to delete it but first posted decided I could post a note about it  
just after starting to write it, I got a notification about the 2025 toki pona meetup  
I went to quickly fill in the form, because everyone's opinion is valid  
on there I saw a link to [ma.pona.la](https://ma.pona.la/) (a collaborative map of toki pona speakers)  
I opened it since I requested to be added a while ago and hadn't looked to see if I was on there yet  
I was impressed by the number of people as I scrolled around the map  
I realised I'm going to Dublin and Hamburg soon so messaged people there just out of interest  
I got distracted on the personal websites I found of the people I messaged  
I changed my Discord profile picture and description as it was outdated  
I got back to writing note about keyboards  
I linked to switching.software in the introduction, so...  
I went to look if switching.software had any mention of android keyboards  
there were none on the website, and none in the issues  
I finished the note, and [linted it](https://blog.alifeee.net/notes/linting-markdown-from-inside-obsidian/)  
markdownlint complained about 4 spaces instead of 2 in lists, which is the default in Obsidian  
so I found out how to write a json rule file for markdownlint to change rule from 4 spaces to 2 spaces  
I posted the note to my website (<https://blog.alifeee.net/notes/choosing-a-free-and-open-android-keyboard/>) and mastodon  
I created a Codeberg account to post an issue to switching.software  
I created [an issue](https://codeberg.org/swiso/website/issues/333) about Android keyboards in switching.software codeberg  
I remembered what I initially set out to do (create a Christmas list) and that I had not done it  
I realised this would be nice to document my "thought train" as a procrastination story  
the time is now  

I hope you can do what you want to do today.
