I started with an old tower computer. I got a phone. I upgraded my tower. I got a laptop. I got a server. I got a new tower for the studio.

Now, I have many computing devices. In an extremely unexciting way, they are called:

- `alifeeePC`
- `alifeeePHONE`
- `alifeeeLAPTOP`
- `alifeeeSERVER`
- `alifeeeGAMINGPC`

Mainly, this makes things like SSH and [SyncThing](https://syncthing.net/) easier to wrangle.

It would be more exciting if they were called `Norman`, `Clownfish`, `Ning Mei`, `Stalwart`, and `Frank`.

I'm always taking suggestions.
