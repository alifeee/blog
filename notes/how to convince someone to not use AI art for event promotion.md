I was asked the question:

- "how do I convince someone that we shouldn't use AI art to create promotion posters for our local event?"

I wanted something a bit more "evidenced" than "[AI is for losers](https://alifeee.net/favourites/images/ai-is-for-losers_fuller.jpeg)" (my usual response), so the below is compiled from that search.

### Pluralistic

I often find Cory Doctorow has good opinions. A lot of his blog posts are mainly about ethics & copyright rather than "disgust", but are still relevant. I found most of these by searching `site:https://pluralistic.net/ ai art` on Kagi

> Herein lies the problem with AI art. Just like with a law school letter of reference generated from three bullet points, the prompt given to an AI to produce creative writing or an image is the sum total of the communicative intent infused into the work. The prompter has a big, numinous, irreducible feeling and they want to infuse it into a work in order to materialize versions of that feeling in your mind and mine. When they deliver a single line's worth of description into the prompt box, then – by definition – that's the only part that carries any communicative freight. The AI has taken one sentence's worth of actual communication intended to convey the big, numinous, irreducible feeling and diluted it amongst a thousand brushtrokes or 10,000 words. I think this is what we mean when we say AI art is soul-less and sterile.

this one is more like useful context why AI is overhyped and "bad, actually".

> The AI sector is utterly dependent on criti-hype. They are burning tens of billions of dollars on engineering salaries, custom chip fabs, human data annotation, data-center rents, racks and racks of GPUs and ASICs, whole gridsworth of electricity and entire aquifers’ worth of fresh water for cooling.
>
> They are hemorrhaging a river of cash, but that river’s source is an ocean-sized reservoir of even more cash.
>
> To keep that reservoir full, the AI industry needs to convince fresh rounds of “investors” to give them hundreds of billions of dollars on the promise of a multi-trillion-dollar payoff.
>

…more opinions…

> Having lived through that era, I'm prepared to believe that maybe I'll look back on AI "art" and say, "damn, I can't believe I never thought that could be real art."
>
> But I wouldn't give odds on it.
>
> I don't like AI art. I find it anodyne, boring. As Henry Farrell writes, it's uncanny, and not in a good way

…and some about the incredible ethics of AI companies

> There is no subject on which AI companies have been more consistently, flagrantly, grotesquely dishonest than training data. When it comes to getting more data, AI companies will lie, cheat and steal in ways that would seem hacky if you wrote them into fiction, like they were pulp-novel dope fiends.
>
> When an AI company tells you it won't use your intimate secrets as training data, they are lying. Of course they're lying! This isn't just any data, it's data that isn't replicated elsewhere on the internet. It's rare – it's unique. It's a competitive advantage. AI companies will 100%, without exception, totally use your private therapy data as training data.
>
> [...]
>
> These companies lie all the time about everything, but the thing they lie most about is how they handle sensitive data. It's wild that anyone has to be reminded of this. Letting AI companies handle your sensitive data is like turning arsonists loose in your library with a can of gasoline, a book of matches, and a pinky-promise that this time, they won't set anything on fire.

### Linked

The following are linked from Cory's blogs above

> LLMs are eerie, then, in a specific and technical sense of that term. The late Mark Fisher wrote an influential book, where he distinguished between the “weird” and the “eerie.” He had an easier time pinning down the weird, because it has a longer tradition and current debate around it. The weird is “that which does not belong,” encompassing both Lovecraftian horrors and natural phenomena like black holes.
>
> The eerie is harder to pin down.
>
>> A sense of the eerie seldom clings to enclosed and inhabited domestic spaces; we find the eerie more readily in landscapes partially emptied of the human. What happened to produce these ruins, this disappearance? What kind of entity was involved? What kind of thing was it that emitted such an eerie cry? As we can see from these examples, the eerie is fundamentally tied up with questions of agency. What kind of agent is acting here? Is there an agent at all?
>
> This captures the specific uncanniness of LLMs and LLM art. LLM art is so disturbing because it is culture that has been drained of all direct intentionality. Just like the movements of the planchette, it is a by-product of collective agency, without itself being an agent. A void has been created, and something disturbing appears to have crept in.
>
>> The sensation of the eerie occurs either when there is something present where there should be nothing, or is there is nothing present when there should be something.

this one is more about copyright

> Most importantly, the tool itself is just data; SD 1.0 was about 4.2GiB of floating-point numbers, I believe. I’m currently using (literally, right now!) another open model, Whisper, which is 3GiB, and allows me to convert most spoken audio into text, and even translate it. I use it to, securely and privately, transcribe what I’m saying to myself through the day.

### reddit

There are lots of opinions (albeit Reddit opinions) on

- <https://www.reddit.com/r/punk/comments/1hsmk5o/venue_keeps_using_ai_to_make_posters/>

Some include:

> This is very NOT DIY or anti-consumerism

> boooo!!!!

> I would boycott that place.

> It’s not punk to fuck around with AI

> Yea it’s sucky and I’m tired of it. I noticed it’s the older bands who do it

> What the absolute fuck?!? If they keep this bullshit up, I sincerely hope they go out of business.

> Boycott. Dont show up to those shows and encourage others to do the same

> Cause nothing says support local artists/bands than asking billionaire owned ai to make art for you, I would rather go to a venue that has shitty looking art for flyers than one that has ai “art”

> I hate AI, it’s making people so lazy and it’ll be the death of creativity

> I 100% call out places that do this. Absolutely chases away anyone with taste.

> Ah dont worry about it, if they are at the point of using AI, they are probably going broke

Comments from [*Gig posters using AI*](https://www.basschat.co.uk/topic/497058-gig-posters-using-ai/) on the Basschat forum.

> Thinking about using AI to generate photos that can be used in band posters. Does anyone have any experience, advice, warnings, threats?

> Do you not have an artistic friend you could slip a few quid to to knock one up? This sort of thing has a "thin end of the wedge" vibe about it.

> "Shame on you," an Instagram user commented. "You exist because of artists and yet you insist on stealing from and subjugating them…"

> Pablo Picasso, by the way, made paintings and lithographs to promote art fairs. Maybe the folks at Oakland's First Fridays could have taken one of those and just made a few "significant adjustments."

This article is actually trying to explain to copywriters (etc.) how they *should* use AI images, by showing them how they shouldn't

> AI images might look technically appealing at first sight, but they fall apart on closer inspection: AI doesn’t know what it does. If you don’t curate your prompts like Shakespeare wrote his sonnets, you’ll end up with images that don’t say anything but: “I used AI to add color.”

### Corrall Design

> AI will also amplify any inherent bias in its training dataset. For example, if a model is trained on a police database and told to suggest jail sentences in a courtroom - something which is already happening in the US - it will have inherited any racial bias that was present in the records of arrests, and be more likely for example, to suggest harsher sentences for black defendants. Famously too, if one prompts Dall-E with the word ‘CEO,’ it will only produce images of white men.

Quotes from a research article: [*Eyes can tell: Assessment of implicit attitudes toward AI art*](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10663653/) by Yizhen Zhou, Hideaki Kawabata:

> [The] results suggest that a negative bias may exist toward [AI-generated artworks]

> [...] although it was difficult for individuals to identify AI-generated artwork, they exhibited an implicit prejudice against AI art

### Computers in Human Behaviour

Quotes from [*Defending humankind: Anthropocentric bias in the appreciation of AI art*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563223000584) by Kobe Millet, Florian Buehler, Guanzhong Du, Michail D. Kokkoris:

> Four experiments [...] consistently reveal a pervasive bias against AI-made artworks

> The same artwork is preferred less when labeled as AI-made [...] and subsequently induces less awe

> These effects are more pronounced among people [...] who believe that creativity is a uniquely human characteristic

## Conclusions

I summarise a lot of the above to the opinions:

- it's ethically bad: you're an indie event and should be promoting (indie) artists, not skipping them for ease and profit
- it puts people off coz it looks creepy
- you lose people's trust: choosing an "easy way out" when it comes to art doesn't build people's confidence in the other organisational bits of your event

…or, put more succinctly:

- AI is for losers
