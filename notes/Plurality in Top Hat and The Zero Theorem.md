Plurality is an interesting state of being. The [Plurality Hub](https://plurality-hub.carrd.co/) describes it as "[…] at it's core, when multiple people inhabit one body."

I've chatted to a few plural people, mainly via Discord. So, I always find it interesting to see portrayals of it in film.

Yesterday I watched [The Zero Theorem](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/157834-the-zero-theorem) (2013). It was meh, but the main character Qohen Leth (Christoph Waltz) was plural — it wasn't really talked about apart from being expressed as being weird by other characters. It felt a bit like it was just there to make Qohen seem weird to the audience.

The more interesting film I watched a while ago was [Top Hat](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/3080-top-hat), a 1935 Ginger Rogers & Fred Astaire film about complications in a hotel — there was a character Bates (Eric Blore) who was plural, and it wasn't really played for laughs. Everyone seemed to accept it without questioning it, and I remember finding it interesting that was the case.

Anyway, let me know if you watch anything else with plural characters. Ideally not where they are only plural because they're "insane" or supposed to be weird.
