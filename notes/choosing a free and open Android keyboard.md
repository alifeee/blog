title: choosing a free and open Android keyboard

A few months ago I was trying to find a keyboard to replace SwiftKey (Microsoft's Android keyboard). The other behemoth in the arena is GBoard, Google's Android keyboard. I didn't want to use either of these because... they're privacy-invading megacorps. My morality aligns more with that of [switching.software](https://switching.software/) or [this page on digital solidarity networks](https://etherpump.vvvvvvaria.org/p/digital-solidarity-networks.raw.html).

## What I wanted

I wanted to find a keyboard that had:

- autocorrect
- (maybe) swipe-typing
- clipboard history
- a number row on the top
- option to change numbers to numberpad

## What I chose

(spoilers) I ended up choosing [FUTO keyboard](https://keyboard.futo.org/), as it seemed ethically good, even though I don't fully enjoy the story of the [FUTO organisation](https://futo.org/). From the about page - it seems fully funded and fully run by one rich guy who escaped silicon valley. I'd rather something more cooperatively minded, but hey-ho.

After using it for a few months, I have gotten used to its quirks (such as not autocorrecting if you are typing a word in between words not separated by a space, etc) and I am not regretting switching nor missing SwiftKey.

## The others

Here are the others I considered:

- [AnySoftKeyboard](https://github.com/AnySoftKeyboard/AnySoftKeyboard) - "The only Android keyboard you'll ever need. Free as in speech and Free as in beer."
    - not available for my device because "it was made for an older version of android"
- [FlorisBoard](https://github.com/florisboard/florisboard) - "FlorisBoard is a free and open-source keyboard for Android 6.0+ devices. It aims at being modern, user-friendly and customizable while fully respecting your privacy. Currently in early-beta state."
    - it's not very updated - the road map is long and large
    - There are no word suggestions or inline autocorrect
    - There's no numpad
- [Futo Keyboard](https://keyboard.futo.org/) - "A modern keyboard that respects your privacy and security, with features such as offline voice input, swipe typing and smart autocorrect."
    - 100mb download??
- [Heliboard](https://github.com/Helium314/HeliBoard) - "A privacy-conscious and customizable open-source keyboard, based on AOSP / OpenBoard with many additional features and improvements, including support for custom dictionaries, themes, and glide typing."
    - no glide typing by default
- [Indic Keyboard](https://indic.app/) - "Indic Keyboard is a versatile keyboard for Android users who wish to use Indic and Indian languages to type messages, compose emails and generally prefer to use them in addition to English on their phone."
    - I don't need Indic
- [OpenBoard](https://github.com/openboard-team/openboard) - "OpenBoard is a 100% foss keyboard based on AOSP, with no dependency on Google binaries, that respects your privacy. It is no longer updated, but still works."
    - needed to create my own dictionary, cba
- [Simple Keyboard](https://github.com/rkkr/simple-keyboard) - "Simply keyboard and nothing more."
    - too simple
