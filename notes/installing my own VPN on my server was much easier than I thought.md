title: installing my own VPN on my server was much easier than I thought

I've thought about installing a VPN on my server for a few months. It wouldn't allow the perhaps-more-common VPN use of getting past region-locked content (as I can't change the region of my server), but as an academic exercise, and for other reasons, I gave it a try installing a VPN on my server.

It was super easy! All I ran was:

```bash
wget https://git.io/vpn -O openvpn-install.sh
sudo bash openvpn-install.sh
```

I accepted all the default settings (IP / UDP / port / DNS servers) apart from username (alifeee), allowed the port through my firewall (which uses Uncomplicated FireWall (`ufw`)) with `sudo ufw allow 1194` (the default port), and a file `alifeee.ovpn` was created. That file was pretty simple, and basically just a few keys, and looked a bit like this:

```ovpn
client
dev tun
proto udp
remote xxx.xx.xxx.xxx 1194
resolv-retry infinite
nobind
persist-key
persist-tun
remote-cert-tls server
auth SHA512
ignore-unknown-option block-outside-dns

This file was small enough that I was able to copy it in only two screens through ConnectBot on my phone. To install it, I:

- opened the VPN settings on Linux, where I could import a `.ovpn` file by default
- installed the OpenVPN app on Android which let me import the file
- I haven't installed it on Windows but I'm presuming it's as easy as installing some OpenVPN app

Since I've installed it, it's actually been pretty useful. I've used it:

- on trains or in caf√©s to hide my traffic (I think)
- to download PlatformIO libraries as my ISP blocked the library hosting website inexplicably
- to access <https://sci-hub.se/>, which my ISP also blocks (this post brought to you by: my ISP being super annoying)

So, if you want to get round blocks, hide your traffic, or other VPN shenanigans, you could create a VPS (Virtual Private Server) and install OpenVPN to it pretty easily. Perhaps you could even get around region locks if you picked a server location in a region you wanted.
