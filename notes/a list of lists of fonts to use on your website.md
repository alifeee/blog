Somebody asked me for a font. I don't know much about fonts. I do know a whole lot about [*making* fonts](https://alifeee.co.uk/fonts/). I also know a whole lot about surfing the web.

Sometimes, you choose to buy a pastry or a loaf from your local bakery instead of your nearly-local supermarket. In the same way, instead of loading up Google Fonts, you could consider picking a font from one of the lists on this page.

Here are some sites that I knew of already:

- lots of interesting fonts: <http://fonts.tom7.com/>
- lots of characterful heading- or otherwise-fonts: <https://about.cubictype.com/>
- lots of crazy wacky [unusable?] fonts: <http://clofont.free.fr/Police/liste_pol.htm> (also the site is in French)

I also searched the web, searching for "fonts for the web" - which didn't turn up anything that good, even with Kagi's ["small web"](https://blog.kagi.com/small-web) toggled - and secondly the same but with "site:neocitites.org". From that, I found these lists which look pretty great:

- more easily explore your system fonts (fonts pre-installed on most people's computers): <https://luctools.neocities.org/whatsyourtype>
- lots of web fonts: <https://humantooth.neocities.org/freefonts>
- organised lists of Google fonts, grouped by vibe: <https://solaria.neocities.org/fonts>
- list of lists of fonts: <https://nuxill.neocities.org/resources#fonts>
- list of freee fonts: <https://goblin-heart.net/sadgrl/webmastery/downloads/fonts>

Never forget, you could also spend way too much timeâ€¦ [making your own font](https://blog.alifeee.co.uk/making-bogface/).
