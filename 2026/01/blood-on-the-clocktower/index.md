## the official set

As mentioned before, the official set will put you back [£141](https://bloodontheclocktower.com/products/blood-on-the-clocktower-the-game). You can find it cheaper on other websites, sometimes down to £100. I've played with an official set before, and it really is very nice.

It also comes with three scripts (Trouble Brewing, Bad Moon Rising, and Sects & Violets), unlike my set which only has the Trouble Brewing characters.

As a comparison to the inside of my set, here's the inside of the official set.

## making my set

I used a few tools and techniques to make the parts of my set. You can see exactly what was used for each part in the interactive contents at the top. Here are some scrappier "in-progress" pictures.

I made everything here at [Sheffield Hackspace](https://www.sheffieldhackspace.org.uk/). I don't have my own laser cutter, 3D printer, or anything like that – it's all made with shared resources.

### laser cutting

After finding [Aechs' tokens](github.com/Aechs/BotCT_Tokens/), I changed the text to [Hershey text](https://www.evilmadscientist.com/2011/hershey-text-an-inkscape-extension-for-engraving-fonts/) so that it would appear better laser-cut, and then tried to find the best laser speed/power settings. Hopefully you agree that the rightmost is the best. The speed/power settings were this, though they'll be different on different laser cutters:

    images: 175/15
    leaf/triangle motifs: 200/12
    names: 200/12
    descriptions: 35/10
    cutout: 18/25

![picture of several laser cut tokens, progressively getting more readable and less burnt-looking](images/making/lasercutter_power-choice.webp)

I cut the tokens one-by-one, as they took about 2-3 minutes each, which gave me time to check and align the next token while the previous was cutting. Here's what it looked like in Lightburn, laser cutting software:

…and here's a token just after it's been cut:

I used one-and-a-half boards of plywood that I bought for a few quid from [Sheffield Hackspace](https://www.sheffieldhackspace.org.uk/)'s stock.

Finally for laser cutting, here's a timelapse video and a realtime video of some of the tokens being cut. You can see how it wasn't a big deal to stand and watch them be cut… as it's quite mesmerising, I think. I especially like the cutting of the tiny text.

### printing, binding, and laminating

I printed a lot of sheets and booklets. Again, to see exactly which, look at the interactive contents at the top of the page. By the end of laminating, I had a pretty developed process of preparing the next sheets while the previous one was laminating.

![picture of laminator laminating a sheet of paper, with a second sheet ready to be laminated](images/making/laminating.webp)

I spent a lot of time with a guillotine afterwards, cropping all the sheets and laminated sheets to have a nice margin. I also bound the two rule booklets with thread.

### 3D printing

The first thing I 3D printed was just for fun, really, as I knew I had about 4 or 5 hours, so I may as well have set off a fairly long print. I only had the character tokens at this point, so I measured them and made a perfectly sized box, to which I added a couple of extra generic compartments for other tokens.

I set off this print and then spent the waiting time laminating and laser cutting.

![picture of a 3D printer printing a small box, just having completed the base, and building up the walls](images/making/tokenbox_printing.webp)

Near the end, I realised I'd forgotten death shrouds. Luckily, lots of people have 3D printed these online, so there were lots of files available already. After testing one, I set off another 15 to print. They fit quite well on my custom tokens :]

### the game box

For the box, I went round some charity shops near me, and bought a sturdy-ish, large-but-not-too-large, square box. The box both houses the stuff (like a normal board game box) but also clips together to become part of the playing pieces!… so I wanted a nice size (not too small so as to fit all the pieces in, not too big as to be annoying).

I also wanted to line the inside with felt, to stop the pieces slipping around when you're playing, but I couldn't get any felt (it was a Sunday and the markets were closed), so I just used some foam that was lying around the hackspace.

With the foam it's really quite impressive what angle you can have the box without the pieces slipping out.

The final thing I did was paint the box black with some acrylic paint (that I got for £1.50 from town). I didn't really prep the box, so the paint is already coming off, but that's fine.

### the 'final' product

In the end, I've ended up with a nice box with the first Blood on the Clocktower script in it. It's not as nice as the official game, has less content (1 of 3 scripts), and would probably end up quite different if I made it again, but it was fun to make :]

## my first game

What's the point in making an entire board game if you don't play it? Not a lot.

A few days after I finished making the game, we played one round after a pot luck. There ended up being 8 players and me, the storyteller. There's a lot to think about, so I made a few mistakes, which were:

- on the first night, there was a lot to do. in my confusion, I woke the chef and told them the empath's info (0 instead of 1), then I didn't wake the empath (both were corrected in the daytime)
- still on the confusiongrind, I told the fortune teller a 0 when they picked their red herring (which was corrected later in the game)

Here's a picture of the final state of the grimoire. Good job evil team ;]

Why not make *your* own copy!? ;]
