# Ring populations

I often like to compare the populations of places. Mainly cities. However, I find that the google-results for this are not great.

Thus, in this repository I'm looking at the population held within a concentric circle centred on a city, to see if it makes a good comparison.

I expect there will be problems, like:

- unfair representation of coastal cities (as circle goes into water)
- difficulty in choosing size of circle:
  - too small, and it may under-represent the urban area of the city
  - too large, and it may include unwanted population
  - too large, and it may end up mostly underwater for coastal cities

## Population websites

Usually if I want to find the population of a city, I just Google it. This may be why I end up with inconsistent results. Many websites exist to tabulate city population. For example:

- <https://simplemaps.com/data/gb-cities>
- <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham>
- <https://worldpopulationreview.com/world-cities/birmingham-population>
- <https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/censuspopulationchange/E08000025/>
- <https://populationdata.org.uk/population-of-birmingham/>
- <https://www.citypopulation.de/en/uk/admin/west_midlands/E08000025__birmingham/>
