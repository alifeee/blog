        <p>
          In 2021, <a href="https://twitter.com/Somebody909">Alex</a> and I
          wanted to go to freshers&#39; fair at Durham to check out what cool,
          post-covid societies had sprung up. To make it entertaining, and force
          ourselves to talk to societies that we wouldn&#39;t otherwise, we
          wanted a creative idea. What we came up with was to take round a
          sketchbook to each society at the fair, and to propose to them
          &quot;please draw something - <em>whatever you feel like</em> - in our
          sketchbook, to represent your society :)&quot;.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many people who acquiesced our request asked us how they could see the
          whole book afterwards, or where it would be posted online. At the time
          we had no response, as we were just doing it for our own amusement.
          But now, thanks to the wonders of digitization, the answer is: right
          here!

          >&quot;, if you can, for the book-like experience)

          It&#39;s very fun to see such the wide range of ideas and creativity
          of people that results when you give them a pen. I also enjoyed that
          the societies ended up being almost paired up in the book, combining
          to create an artistic spread.
        </p>
        <p>
          I implore you to &#39;flick&#39; through the book above (it&#39;s
          clickable!), but I also highlight some of my favourite pages here. (or
          even ask me in person, and I might even just find the strange drawer
          or shelf where it has ended up.)
        </p>
        <h3 id="purple-radio">Purple Radio</h3>
        <p>
          This was one of the first sketches and I just think it&#39;s neat.
        </p>
        <p>
          <img
            src="images/purple-radio.png"
            alt="Image of person smiling and talking into a microphone, with Purple Radio's logo above"
          />
        </p>
        <h3 id="archaeology-society">Archaeology Society</h3>
        <p>
          This one took by far the longest. Perhaps you can tell, because the
          result is beautiful. This also meant that Alex and I were forced to
          learn a hell of a lot about archaeology in those 15 minutes.
        </p>
        <p>
          <img
            src="images/archaeology.png"
            alt="Very detailed image of skull wearing wreath, with archaeology society written adjacent"
          />
        </p>
        <h3 id="the-honorable-dc">&quot;The Honorable D.C.&quot;</h3>
        <p>
          This is the only sketch which isn&#39;t labelled. To this day, I have
          no idea which society drew this one. Even knowing the section of the
          room it was in, neither Alex nor I could recall who drew it. Great
          sketch though.
        </p>
        <p>
          <img src="images/the-honorable-dc.png" alt="A face with only eyes and
          a pig-like snout, with "THE HONORABLE D.C." written underneath">

        <h3 id="marxist-society--veg-soc">Marxist Society &amp; Veg Soc</h3>
        <p>
          This is my favourite double-page spread in the book as both pages are
          richly full. Both societies filled the brief and made wonderful pages.
        </p>
        <p>
          <img
            src="images/marxist-veg.png"
            alt="Double page spread. On left: Marxist imagery filling the whole page, including hammer and sickle, motifs. On right: Veg Soc logo spelled out with hand-drawn vegetables, with a PETA sticker."
          />
        </p>
        <h3 id="wine--cheese-society">Wine &amp; Cheese Society</h3>
        <p>
          From talking to Wine &amp; Cheese Society, it was all about having a
          laff. Their picture definitely respects that.
        </p>
        <p>
          <img src="images/wine-and-cheese.png" alt="Drawing of person passed
          out, drinking from a bottle labelled "Merlot", next to a table of
          grapes and cheese. Page titled "WINE + CHEESE SOC DRINKS

          Finally, an entry after our own heart. After spending 6 hours ambling
          through the freshers&#39; fair, sitting among rushed students and
          leaning around talking to whoever would listen to us, this haiku is
          very reflective.

          Haiku commences: "This freshers' fair is // covered in plastic and
          feet // I hate this a lot">

          I hope you enjoyed a scroll through Durham University&#39;s social
          scene in 2021. If you didn&#39;t do so, slow down there! Have a look.
          Absorb some of the creativity within.
