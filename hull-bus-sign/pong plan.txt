# constants
screen size pixels (x, y) int
sensor size pixels (x, y) int
paddle size (x, y) int
ball initial position (x, y) float
ball initial velocity (x, y) float

# variables
player left pos (y) float
player right pos (y) float
ball pos (x, y) float
ball velocity (x, y) float
player left score int
player right score int

# computables
delta (from millis() or micros())

# functions
draw paddles
 draw pixel for size
draw ball
 draw 2x2 pixels? round position
draw score
get player from touch event (past midpoint)
get y fraction from touch event

# initial
draw score to bottom panel

# game loop (every frame)
compute delta
deal with touch events
 for each event
  get player
  get y
  set player position to y
deal with ball
 work out ball's next position
 if off top of screen
  reverse y velocity
  set position to top of screen
 if off bottom of screen
  same as above but swapped
 if off left of screen
  if y is within left player paddle y
   reverse x velocity
   set position to left of screen
  else
   reset ball position to initial position + velocity
   increment player right score
   draw new score to bottom panel
 if off right of screen
  do same as above but for right player
 else
  add velocity to ball position
clear pixels
draw paddles
draw ball
send display()
