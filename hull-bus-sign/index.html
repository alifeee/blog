        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Several weeks ago I wandered into
          <a href="https://linktr.ee/makerspacehull">Hull Makerspace</a> to see
          what it was like. At the time the only Makerspace (<a
            href="https://www.makerspaces.com/what-is-a-makerspace/"
            >what is a Makerspace?</a
          >) I had been to was <a href="https://fizzpop.org.uk/">fizzPOP</a> in
          Birmingham, so I wanted to see what others were like. After reading
          about computing pedagogy in some
          <a href="https://helloworld.raspberrypi.org/">magazines</a> I found, I
          stumbled across an interesting looking GitHub repository on Hull
          Makerspace&#39;s
          <a href="https://linktr.ee/makerspacehull">linktr.ee</a> (as of now
          it&#39;s no longer there). It was titled &quot;Bus Terminal
          Signs&quot; and the initial readme contained only the lines:
        </p>
        <p>
          <code
            >Everything we found out about these signs and Arduino code to drive
            them</code
          >
        </p>
        <p><code>This is a work in progress.</code></p>
        <p>
          The only thing I knew about &quot;bus terminal signs&quot; was that
          for a few years, the ones at Hull&#39;s bus station were broken, with
          the solution of printed A4 paper with bus timetables stuck to each
          door. Eventually, they were replaced by LED screens. (Personally, I
          think dot matrix displays are great and shouldn&#39;t be replaced
          under the reasoning that they&#39;re &#39;old technology&#39;, as
          commenters suggest
          <a
            href="https://www.ianvisits.co.uk/articles/euston-station-testing-new-departure-display-boards-58759/"
            >here</a
          >.)
        </p>
        <p>
          I asked the Makerspace staff, and they told me that my suspicions were
          correct, and when the bus station had ditched the old signs for good,
          they had asked Hull Makerspace if they wanted the (broken) signs. Of
          course, they said yes. A year or so ago the Makerspace had given them
          out to members, but they still had two or three hidden behind some
          workbenches, so they pulled one out for me behind the scenes. Here it
          is!
        </p>
        <p>
          <img src="images/hw_sign_closed.jpg" alt="Picture of bus sign on a
          workbench. It is a long blue and black dot matrix display with the
          titles "Service", "Destination", and "Time"">
        </p>
        <p>
          I had a bit of a deeper look into the
          <a
            href="https://github.com/ConnectedHumber/Bus-Terminal-Signs/tree/924d6c9f16a497d58154f33e4dc9a63ff28e7344"
            ><code>Bus Terminal Signs</code> GitHub repository</a
          >
          and saw that
          <a
            href="https://github.com/ConnectedHumber/Bus-Terminal-Signs/blob/924d6c9f16a497d58154f33e4dc9a63ff28e7344/Code/CH_AS1100.cpp#L3"
            >Paul Richards</a
          >
          and <a href="https://github.com/BNNorman">Brian Norman</a> had
          documented part of their work with the signs, including datasheets,
          images, and code to interface with the chips on the signs. Knowing
          what I knew about electronics, C, and hardware, I saw this as a great
          opportunity for a self-contained and fun project I could work on at
          the Makerspace! My initial ambitions were that: I wanted to set up the
          signs myself and get them displaying pixels and/or text; and I wanted
          to document the process a bit more, so that others who had taken signs
          home could understand more easily how to use them.
        </p>
        <p>
          The end result was that I improved the original documentation, and it
          is now hosted on the same repository:
          <a href="https://github.com/ConnectedHumber/Bus-Terminal-Signs/"
            >ConnectedHumber/Bus-Terminal-Signs</a
          >! On there is a step-by-step guide on setting up the signs as well as
          many images. On the rest of this page, I will go into a bit more depth
          (and in a bit more of a storytelling theme) on my electronical
          adventure with the signs :)
        </p>
        <h2 id="opening-it-up">Opening it up</h2>
        <p>
          The first step was to... take it all apart and look at the wires! With
          only four allen-key twists, we got the sign open to have a better look
          inside. Here&#39;s what it looks like open, with the LED panels lifted
          on their hinge:
        </p>
        <p>
          <img
            src="images/hw_sign_open.png"
            alt="Picture of the bus sign with the front panel lifted. You can see the individual LED dot matrix panels."
          />
        </p>
        <p>
          Inside there are a
          <a
            href="https://github.com/ConnectedHumber/Bus-Terminal-Signs/blob/8442f09b8f9d1832f875e6f604bd82d333bfda3f/pics/Control%20Modules.png"
            >lot of electronics</a
          >. There were two leads coming out of the box: a severed 3-core power
          cable; and an Ethernet cable. I had initially considered trying to
          hack into the Ethernet cable by sending the &quot;correct&quot;
          requests, and maybe the sign would <em>magically work</em>. This would
          probably not happen, so instead I wired directly into the microchips
          controlling the LEDs!...
        </p>
        <h2 id="how-to-connect-to-a-bunch-of-scary-looking-electronics">

        </h2>
        <p>
          Here is a zoom of the sign. As you can see, the LEDs come in panels,
          which are removable. Under each panel are four microchips (called
          AS1100 chips -
          <a
            href="https://github.com/ConnectedHumber/Bus-Terminal-Signs/blob/master/Datasheets/AS1100_DS000273_1-00.pdf"
            >datasheet</a
          >
          for the strong-hearted) for controlling the lights. These are wired up
          so that each chip controls a 6 x 8 pixel grid, and there are four of
          these per LED panel.
        </p>
        <p>
          <img
            src="images/hw_sign_as1100-chips.jpg"
            alt="Close-up picture of the electronics behind one of the panels on the display. Four AS1100 chips are visible."
          />
        </p>
        <figcaption>
          <p>
            One panel is 24 x 9 pixels. The bottom row isn&#39;t used, leaving
            four 6 x 8 grids, which each of these four chips controls.
          </p>
        </figcaption>

        <p>
          The AS1100 chips are daisy-chained together, so you only have to
          attach wires to the input of the first chip, and then it outputs a
          delayed signal into the input of the next chip. All-in-all, 32 chips
          are daisy-chained together on the top row, and the same on the bottom.
          The rows are controlled independently. This is shown as a diagram in
          the
          <a

        <figcaption>
          <p>
            A curious note: the AS1100 chips are actually <em>not</em> designed
            to drive dot-matrix displays, but instead
            &quot;<em>should</em>&quot; be used for 7-segment displays. Their
            ability to drive dot matrix displays is just secondary and covered
            in this single diagram in the datasheet.
          </p>

        <p>So...! We only need to wire into the first chip.</p>
        <h3 id="ribbon-cable">Ribbon cable</h3>
        <p>
          Handily, there is already a ribbon cable, connecting from the PCB
          containing the chips (above) to the aforementioned
          <a
            href="https://github.com/ConnectedHumber/Bus-Terminal-Signs/blob/8442f09b8f9d1832f875e6f604bd82d333bfda3f/pics/Control%20Modules.png"
            >&quot;bunch of electronics&quot;</a
          >
          (below).
        </p>
        <p>
          <img
            src="images/hw_sign_ribbon-cable.jpg"
            alt="Close-up of a ribbon cable connected to a PCB via a socket."
          />
        </p>
        <p>
          It was already worked out which ribbon cable pins connect to which
          terminals on the AS1100 chips by BNNorman (<a
            href="https://github.com/ConnectedHumber/Bus-Terminal-Signs/#pin-designation"
            >Ribbon cable pin designation</a
          >), so all I had to do was figure out a way to connect the ribbon
          cable wires to an
          <a href="https://store.arduino.cc/products/arduino-uno-rev3"
            >Arduino</a
          >. Without ordering any parts online, the easiest way I could think to
          do that was to... just solder straight onto the back of the pins of
          the ribbon cable connector.
        </p>
        <p>
          I initially marked the cable-to-solder-pad mapping the wrong way round
          (I had the first pin on the bottom right), but using a multimeter, I
          noticed it was wrong. I probably should&#39;ve realised that just like
          the red marking on the ribbon cable designating wire 1, the square
          soldering pad on the PCB also designated pin 1. If you imagine it,
          though, this means there are some funky Z-shaped wires inside the
          connector to make the pins connect to the opposite side that they
          entered in. Weird.
        </p>
        <p>

        <h3 id="soldering">Soldering</h3>
        <p>
          To solder some wires onto the PCB, I first had to have some wires.
          Revolutionary. So I cut some lengths from wire coils, stripped them,
          tinned them, and crimped them (all skills which Hull Makerspace was
          more than glad to help with).
        </p>

            alt="Picture of several loose stripped wires above an electronics workbench."
          />
        </p>
        <p>
          And the final soldering. As they say, &quot;you shouldn&#39;t use
          solder for strength&quot;, but hey... I can pick up this circuit board
          by just the wires now. They only came off three times when I did that.

          These wires are only for controlling the logic of the chips. The LEDs
          are powered separately. So, the only connections we need here are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Ground</li>
          <li>ISET (sets the brightness of the LEDs)</li>
          <li>DATA (for sending data packets)</li>
          <li>CLOCK (for synchronising data sending)</li>
          <li>
            LOAD (for telling the chip when we have finished sending data)
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In other words, this is

          you&#39;ll see below.
        </p>
        <p>
          After soldering, we can put it together and connect the wires to the
          sign (as well as connecting power to it)...

          This was the end of the journey beginning &quot;let&#39;s plug it in
          and see if it immediately works&quot;, with the sad answer of &quot;it
          doesn&#39;t&quot;. Now, it was time for some investigative
          electronics, i.e., sticking an oscilloscope to things and seeing what
          happens.
        </p>
        <h2 id="what-is-spi">What is SPI?</h2>
        <p>
          All about SPI! With only the datasheet in-hand, I started in the dark
          corner of &quot;I have no idea what SPI is&quot;, and played around
          with an oscilloscope until I understood what was happening.
        </p>
        <p>
          SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) is a way for one piece of
          electronics to send messages to another one, used mainly for devices
          that are physically next to each other and always attached with the
          same wires. One device is a &quot;host&quot; and the other a
          &quot;listener&quot;.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here is the explanation of SPI from the
          <a
            href="https://github.com/ConnectedHumber/Bus-Terminal-Signs/blob/master/Datasheets/AS1100_DS000273_1-00.pdf"

          SPI communication had been set up in the
          <a
            href="https://github.com/ConnectedHumber/Bus-Terminal-Signs/tree/924d6c9f16a497d58154f33e4dc9a63ff28e7344"

          code by using &quot;bit banging&quot;, where wire signals are changed
          to <strong>HIGH</strong> and <strong>LOW</strong> using Arduino code.
          I wanted to change this to use Arduino&#39;s SPI library, as it is
          faster and less error-prone, but first I had to understand SPI. So,
          Hull Makerspace found me an oscilloscope. This, I attached to two SPI
          wires, <strong>CLOCK</strong> and <strong>DATA</strong> (explained
          below), to see what was happening when the Arduino sent a signal to
          the bus sign.
        </p>

        <p>
          For SPI, there are three wires. A <em>clock</em> wire, a
          <em>data</em> wire, and a <em>load</em> wire. When the
          <strong>host</strong> wants to send a message (2 bytes), they
          oscillate the <em>clock</em> signal up and down 16 times (16 bits),
          and each time it goes up they put the <em>data</em> wire to the
          corresponding bit of the byte(s). I used the Arduino to send the SPI
          signal 0x0E02 (0000 1110 0000 0010), and the voltage on the wires
          looked like this:
        </p>
        <p>
          <img
            src="images/sw_oscilloscope_bad-spi.png"
            alt="Digital image of oscilloscope trace. Above: yellow signal oscillating. Below: blue signal turning on and off less frequently."
          />
        </p>
        <figcaption>
          <p>
            Top, yellow: clock signal. Bottom, blue: data signal. Grey vertical
            lines: rising edge of the clock signal, which triggers the device to
            read from the data line. See that 0x0E02 is encoded in the blue
            signal as 0000&nbsp;1110&nbsp;0000&nbsp;0010.
          </p>
        </figcaption>

        <p>
          So, it looked like the SPI was working! In fact, it was. The real
          problem was that the voltage was too low. It needed to be 5 V to be
          registered by the bus sign, and as you can see above, it was anywhere
          from around 3 to 4 V. This meant that only some peaks in the above
          signal were registered by the sign, so it was basically receiving
          rubbish. That explained the flickering.
        </p>
        <p>
          The root cause of this problem was that the Arduino wasn&#39;t
          grounded to the same ground as the bus sign, and as soon as I
          connected the common grounds the signal corrected itself, and became
          the below. Nice and neat.
        </p>
        <p>
          <img
            src="images/hw_oscilloscope_trace.jpg"
            alt="Picture of oscilloscope screen, showing neat SPI trace."
          />
        </p>
        <figcaption>
          <p>
            One SPI message, taking up the whole screen. Top, yellow: clock
            signal. Bottom, blue: data signal.
          </p>
        </figcaption>

        <p>
          With this 5 V signal, the sign worked perfectly, so it turned out
          there was nothing wrong with the code. However, at this point, I had
          spent almost two days figuring out how SPI works, so I
          <a
            href="https://github.com/ConnectedHumber/Bus-Terminal-Signs/commit/42d419e2f393794e35022eb3a698ca0bd0645b34"
            >changed the code to use Arduino&#39;s native SPI</a
          >
          anyway. It ended up being only a couple of lines:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-arduino">void Panel::write16(int d) {
  SPI.beginTransaction(SPISettings(10000000, MSBFIRST, SPI_MODE3));
  SPI.transfer16(d);
  SPI.endTransaction();
}
</code></pre>
        <p>
          Finally, the third wire in SPI is used for confirmation. You can have
          multiple devices connected to your <strong>CLOCK</strong> and
          <strong>DATA</strong> signals, and then you can send a final signal on
          the <strong>LOAD</strong> wire of a specific device to make it process
          the signal. This can be seen on this trace:
        </p>
        <p>
          <img
            src="images/hw_oscilloscope_signal.jpg"
            alt="Picture of oscilloscope screen, showing SPI trace more zoomed out."
          />
        </p>
        <figcaption>
          <p>
            The same SPI message from above but with LOAD instead of DATA,
            zoomed out. Top, yellow: clock signal. Bottom, blue: load signal.
            The load signal is sent with software, so takes longer than the
            internal SPI communications.
          </p>
        </figcaption>

        <h3 id="the-fix">The fix!</h3>
        <p>
          Now that SPI was fixed, after not actually being broken, I could start
          using the sign as intended: as a customisable dot matrix display! The
          first thing was to make sure it worked, so I sent the debug command
          which flashes on/off all the LEDs, and...
        </p>
        <p>It worked!</p>

        <p>
          Now that I could use the sign fairly effectively, I wanted to get
          something cool set up. I had originally wanted to set up a server on
          the sign so that anyone could connect and change the text, so that it
          could be displayed somewhere. However, my friend John had just given
          me a
          <a href="https://neonode.com/technologies/zforce/touch-sensor-modules"
            >&quot;touchless touch sensor&quot;</a
          >, so another friend suggested I make Pong with this touch sensor as a
          controller.
        </p>
        <p>
          The way time works had meant I only had one day to make the game, so I
          got stuck in. The first thing I did was plan the game in pseudocode.
          Here&#39;s a snippet of the
          <a href="./pong%20plan.txt">full thing</a>, with (most of) my plan for
          the game loop.

          I used this to write the code in Arduino&#39;s language, and it
          basically... just worked :) Here&#39;s the result!

        <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          Pong! The signs were pretty fun to get working and use, and I now have
          many ideas and other things I want to do with them. Some things I want
          to do are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Set up a sign with a QR code attached, which lets you change the
            text displayed on a whim (e.g., by using a Raspberry Pi instead of
            an Arduino, which can use Wi-Fi to host a server with the tool to
            change the text)
          </li>
          <li>
            Using it to show the next train/bus departures, returning it to its
            initial use (just like the
            <a
              href="https://ukdepartureboards.co.uk/store/product/desktop-departures"
              >Desktop Departures® Board</a
            >)
          </li>
          <li>
            Make more games! For example: that tower stacking game where the
            tower gets thinner if you mistime the stacking; Tetris.
          </li>
          <li>Anything else! Got any ideas?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          It would also be nice to close the lid of the display, so it is
          portable. When they were uninstalled from the bus station, the power
          cables were all cut off, so the main part of this is just rewiring a
          3-pin plug onto the box.
        </p>
        <p>
          Screwing around with this sign has been great contained electronical
          shenanigans! E-waste no more.
