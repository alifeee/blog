# Folding an A4 sheet into its own envelope

I like sending post. A lot. Snail mail is full of intrigue, fun, and wonder.

Here is a nice way of folding a piece of A4 paper into an self-contained envelope. It folds in such a way that you can use the postage stamp to keep it closed.

The single- and double-lines on the first image represent equal width sections. To find the middle of these, you can pinch the left and bottom edge in half.

Here is an example, folded by a friend:

Credit where credit is due, I stole the idea from <https://pigeonposted.com/>, and made the diagram myself. They do the folding with specifically printed patterned paper, but it's just as tenable to do it with plain, or non-specific patterned paper.

Or use a map.

Or use anything.

Send post! We love it.
