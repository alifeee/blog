        <h1>3D printing a repair for my sellotape dispenser</h1>
        <h2>The dispenser</h2>
        <p>
          I like attaching things to other things. Thus, my sellotape dispenser
          means a lot to me.
        </p>
        <p>
          A few years ago, and after a short while in autonomy peeling and
          cutting tape raw from the reel, all the time with grand memories of a
          heavy sellotape dispenser-filled childhood, my sister and I realised
          we could bring our nostalgic goggles into the present by... each
          buying our own sellotape dispenser.
        </p>
        <p>I have to say, it has revolutionised my life.</p>
        <p>

            alt="picture of a sellotape dispenser with a pair of scissors and a roll of tape leaning against it"
          />
        </p>
        <h2>The repairs</h2>
        <p>
          A while ago I dropped the dispenser from a height (I was balancing it
          on the top of a door). When it fell, what I&#39;m calling the arms of
          what I&#39;m calling the core of what I&#39;m calling the wheel
          snapped off.
        </p>
        <p>They&#39;re what lets the wheel spin around in the trough.</p>
        <p>
          <img
            src="./wheel.jpg"
            alt="picture of the original inside wheel of a sellotape dispenser"
          />
        </p>
        <p>
          So, the tape now fell straight into the dispenser and didn&#39;t spin
          properly.
        </p>
        <p>
          <img
            src="./PXL_20240913_130417332.jpg"
            alt="picture of a sellotape dispenser from above, with no tape"
          />
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, one thing I love almost as much as tape and papercraft is
          repairing things. I thought it was a nice opportunity for 3D printing,
          as I hadn&#39;t 3D printed anything before, and it was a small,
          specifically shaped item. Perfect.
        </p>
        <p>
          I couldn&#39;t find anything online already for &quot;Rapesco 500
          sellotape core&quot;, so I drew a schematic and gave it to my friend
          who graciously made a 3D model.
        </p>
        <p>
          <img
            src="./schematic_poor.png"
            alt="drawing of a schematic of the core of a sellotape dispenser"
          />
        </p>
        <p>
          Here&#39;s a screenshot of the 3D model. You can download the STL here
          (<a href="./Tape%20Roller.STL"><code>Tape Roller.STL</code></a
          >) or on the GitHub repository (<a
            href="https://github.com/alifeee/rapesco-500-sellotape-dispenser-core"
            >https://github.com/alifeee/rapesco-500-sellotape-dispenser-core</a
          >). I haven&#39;t used thingiverse or printables or any of those
          sites; GitHub seemed fine enough for sharing the file. If you download
          the STL, you can also preview it in 3D in your browser on
          <a href="https://www.viewstl.com/">https://www.viewstl.com/</a> or
          <a href="https://3dviewer.net/">https://3dviewer.net/</a> (or googling
          &quot;STL viewer online&quot;).

        </p>
        <p>
          I printed the piece at, and with help from the members of, Sheffield
          Hackspace (<a href="https://www.sheffieldhackspace.org.uk/"
            >https://www.sheffieldhackspace.org.uk/</a
          >). It turned out pretty nice!
        </p>

          <img
            src="./printed_bits.jpg"
            alt="several pictures of a small piece of 3D printed plastic"
          />
        </p>
        <p>...and it fit into the wheel perfectly!</p>
        <p>
          <img
            src="./PXL_20240913_130452739.jpg"
            alt="picture of the inside wheel of a sellotape dispenser, with 3D printed plastic part inside"
          />
        </p>
        <p>
          I could have fixed it in countless other ways. Perhaps simply with a
          bamboo skewer. But, 3D printing was fun and I&#39;d been meaning to
          try it for a while. Perhaps, as it breaks further, I&#39;ll replace
          other parts of it, and I&#39;ll eventually own Theseus&#39; sellotape
          dispenser.
        </p>
        <p>For now, onto more taping!</p>
