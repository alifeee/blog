<h1>3D printing a repair for my sellotape dispenser</h1>
<h2>The dispenser</h2>
<p>I like attaching things to other things. Thus, my sellotape dispenser means a lot to me.</p>
<p>A few years ago, and after a short while in autonomy peeling and cutting tape raw from the reel, all the time with grand memories of a heavy sellotape dispenser-filled childhood, my sister and I realised we could bring our nostalgic goggles into the present by... each buying our own sellotape dispenser.</p>
<p>I have to say, it has revolutionised my life.</p>
<p><img src="./PXL_20240913_130659660.jpg" alt="picture of a sellotape dispenser with a pair of scissors and a roll of tape leaning against it"></p>
<h2>The repairs</h2>
<p>A while ago I dropped the dispenser from a height (I was balancing it on the top of a door). When it fell, what I&#39;m calling the arms of what I&#39;m calling the core of what I&#39;m calling the wheel snapped off.</p>
<p>They&#39;re what lets the wheel spin around in the trough.</p>
<p><img src="./wheel.jpg" alt="picture of the original inside wheel of a sellotape dispenser"></p>
<p>So, the tape now fell straight into the dispenser and didn&#39;t spin properly.</p>
<p><img src="./PXL_20240913_130417332.jpg" alt="picture of a sellotape dispenser from above, with no tape"></p>
<p>Now, one thing I love almost as much as tape and papercraft is repairing things. I thought it was a nice opportunity for 3D printing, as I hadn&#39;t 3D printed anything before, and it was a small, specifically shaped item. Perfect.</p>
<p>I couldn&#39;t find anything online already for &quot;Rapesco 500 sellotape core&quot;, so I drew a schematic and gave it to my friend who graciously made a 3D model.</p>
<p><img src="./schematic_poor.png" alt="drawing of a schematic of the core of a sellotape dispenser"></p>
<p>Here&#39;s a screenshot of the 3D model. You can download the STL here (<a href="./Tape%20Roller.STL"><code>Tape Roller.STL</code></a>) or on the GitHub repository (<a href="https://github.com/alifeee/rapesco-500-sellotape-dispenser-core">https://github.com/alifeee/rapesco-500-sellotape-dispenser-core</a>). I haven&#39;t used thingiverse or printables or any of those sites; GitHub seemed fine enough for sharing the file. If you download the STL, you can also preview it in 3D in your browser on <a href="https://www.viewstl.com/">https://www.viewstl.com/</a> or <a href="https://3dviewer.net/">https://3dviewer.net/</a> (or googling &quot;STL viewer online&quot;).</p>
<p><img src="./core_render.png" alt="3D render of the core of a sellotape dispenser"></p>
<p>I printed the piece at, and with help from the members of, Sheffield Hackspace (<a href="https://www.sheffieldhackspace.org.uk/">https://www.sheffieldhackspace.org.uk/</a>). It turned out pretty nice!</p>
<p><img src="./printed_bits.jpg" alt="several pictures of a small piece of 3D printed plastic"></p>
<p>...and it fit into the wheel perfectly!</p>
<p><img src="./PXL_20240913_130452739.jpg" alt="picture of the inside wheel of a sellotape dispenser, with 3D printed plastic part inside"></p>
<p>I could have fixed it in countless other ways. Perhaps simply with a bamboo skewer. But, 3D printing was fun and I&#39;d been meaning to try it for a while. Perhaps, as it breaks further, I&#39;ll replace other parts of it, and I&#39;ll eventually own Theseus&#39; sellotape dispenser.</p>
<p>For now, onto more taping!</p>
