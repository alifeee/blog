# Bike to Cambridge

Directories:

| Path | Description |
| --- | --- |
| ./data/ | Mostly GPX files of the routes taken and considered. See [data/README.md](data/README.md). |
| ./images/ | Images used in the blog. |
| ./src/ | Scripts used to play with the data and generate some images. |

## Note on image size

Photos from my Google Pixel are large. They are resized using Windows photo viewer's "Resize image". Generally I make them 500kb or less. This tends to rip the metadata out of the image, but that's fine for now. If I need it, I can find the original image on my phone.
