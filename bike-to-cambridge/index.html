        <p>In April, I biked from Birmingham to Cambridge.</p>
        <p>
          More accurately, I half-biked, half-trained from Birmingham to
          Cambridge.
        </p>
        <p>
          The original plan was to be on the bike the whole way, from Birmingham
          to Leamington Spa, to Wellingborough, through Bedford, and finally
          into Cambridge (it may sound a haphazard route, but I&#39;d managed to
          find someone who would host me at each town!). This route was half on
          established cycle routes, and half country roads where I&#39;d have to
          find my own way. Not bad, but it might be annoying to navigate on
          roads which were completely new to me.
        </p>
        <p>
          But then... why should I have to bike on unlabelled routes and
          terrible roads? Why am I biking in the first place? Ultimately:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Because I can,</li>
          <li>It sounds fun,</li>
          <li>
            I&#39;ve always wanted to go on a bike tour and this is almost that
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Therefore, why bother with a convoluted and annoying bike just for the
          sake of having biked the whole way. Let&#39;s ditch the idea of
          &quot;purity&quot;... and just catch a few trains to make it more
          pleasant. Here was the final route:

        <p>
          In an ideal world, I would have biked closer to Cambridge, but I
          injured my foot just before the final day, so I couldn&#39;t. Hence,
          the horrific detour by train! (turns out, the Bedfordshire council
          <em>does not</em> let you take a bike onto their buses)

        <p>
          As the crow flies, the distance from my house to where I ended up in
          Cambridge is 141.1 km. If said crow got tired and wanted to stop off
          at the same places I stopped off, the distance would be 148.4 km
          (thanks to my friend trigonometry for such a small change.)

            If I were a crow, it would be a nice life. I would also get to
            Cambridge in 148 km, with stopovers. From

        <p>
          According to my records, I biked 150.3 km. That&#39;s more than 148.4
          km!
        </p>
        <p>
          I&#39;m better than a crow! Or, I can (in the most roundabout of
          technicalities) now say:
        </p>
        <p>&quot;I biked the distance from Birmingham to Cambridge!&quot;</p>
        <p>
          That sounds pretty good! I&#39;ll start telling people that, and
          they&#39;ll be none the wiser.

        <p>
          Before this, I&#39;d not planned a very long bike ride before. I had
          biked from Durham to Newcastle, but that&#39;s basically a straight
          shot up the A167 until you find a &quot;Newcastle Road&quot; that you
          can follow. The biggest gripe I remember from this and other long-ish
          rides was that the directions
          <a href="https://google.com/maps">Google Maps</a> gave me were: not
          great for biking; and took <em>way</em> longer than the estimate said.
          These are basically encapsulated in what I will call my &quot;top 2
          criteria for a perfect bike route&quot;:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            I don&#39;t want to bike on roads unfriendly to bikes (I think I
            should be allowed to desire to not be run over by a car)
          </li>
          <li>
            I don&#39;t want to stop to check my phone for directions (I&#39;m
            afraid I&#39;m not bourgeois enough to have one of those fancy phone
            holders on my handlebars)
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          I ended up finding a great website for finding any distance bike
          routes: <a href="https://cycle.travel">cycle.travel</a>. As well as
          actual bike-friendly routes (which are, naturally, slightly longer
          than Google&#39;s suggestions but ten times more pleasant to bike on),
          the website provides some information about the type of roads on the
          route. This solves the first problem above, and also how I figure
          that...

        <p>
          Now personally, 2 of these 5 road types I find enjoyable to bike
          along, and the other three far less so. I&#39;ll leave it to you to
          imagine which. Needless to say, the directions Google gives you are
          <em>not</em> made for cycling.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, <a href="https://google.com/maps">Google Maps</a> seems
          to think that you are some kind of cycling God, presumably decked out
          with Lycra, speed stripes, and one of those back-pockets. I say this
          because the time estimate it gives you expects you to be cycling
          <strong>19.1 km/h</strong>. If you aren&#39;t acutely aware of the
          relative speeds of biking, what are you doing with your life. But, if
          not, I would describe this as &quot;very fast&quot;. To contextualise:
          over three days, I managed an average of 12.6 km/h, and going what I
          felt was a moderate speed I would get to about 15 km/h. Meanwhile,
          <a href="https://cycle.travel">cycle.travel</a>&#39;s travel time
          estimates estimate that you are doing around 15.8 km/h. Much more
          reasonable. (though I <em>personally</em> still have to add an hour to
          any time estimates. What can I say, I love dawdling.)
        </p>
        <p>
          So, <a href="https://cycle.travel">cycle.travel</a> (or probably many
          other cycling websites) solves my first bike route desire: I don&#39;t
          want to be run over. How do we solve the second: I don&#39;t want a
          SatNav?
        </p>
        <h2 id="national-cycle-routes">National Cycle Routes!</h2>
        <p>
          Biking can be very pleasant when it&#39;s relaxing and stress-free
          (see: when there are no cars). National Cycle Routes are exactly that!
          They are a network of paths, roads, and bridges through the UK which
          are kept navigable, and they are all very well signed.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            The National Cycle Network is a UK-wide network of signed paths and
            routes for walking, wheeling, cycling and exploring outdoors.

          The goal of national cycle routes is to make it pleasant to bike on
          them. As I have expressed, the main goal of this whole adventure was
          also to have an enjoyable time, so why not use national cycle routes
          as much as possible!

          Why get lost when you can not get lost
        </h3>
        <p>
          One of my favourite things about the routes is that they are very well
          signed. <a href="https://www.sustrans.org.uk/">Sustrans</a> do a great
          job keeping them up to date and making any diversions obvious. Set off
          down a route, and you&#39;ll encounter a familiar blue and red sign at
          every turn keeping you on track. This pretty neatly deals with my
          &quot;I don&#39;t want to stop for directions&quot; criterion.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you blindly follow the routes, you will end up skirting round

          if you try and zoom through everywhere that you visit via the fastest
          route possible.

          There is a definite comfort in knowing that you&#39;re on the right
          track. If I weren&#39;t, then after every turn I&#39;d feel the need
          to check if I&#39;m going the right way, so I don&#39;t end up
          careening down a hill for ten minutes only to find I&#39;ve made a
          wrong turn and all the freewheeling fun was for nothing.

          The national cycles routes come with the problem that they might
          simply not align with where you want to go. That was certainly the
          case for me. You try and find a good way from Birmingham to Cambridge
          that doesn&#39;t end up in a huge detour of a winding mess.

          However, for me, biking along a cycle route offers too many benefits
          in contrast to the alternative: making sweeping shortcuts across
          Northamptonshire.

          If my mind was cavernous and my thighs thunderous, I would be able to
          set off and bike straight towards Cambridge. Stopping only to sleep,
          this is the overall direction I would end up going in, thanks to petty
          limitations of the real world like &quot;roads don&#39;t go in
          perfectly straight lines&quot;:

          The sad news was I don&#39;t have a cavernous mind or thunderous
          thighs (the latter is at least achievable with more cycling). And with
          the fact that the direct route lies on approximately zero national
          cycle routes, it did not seem a good way to go. However! There was a
          solution! Trains! I could just hop on a quick 30-minute train and
          re-align myself with the curious spider web of cycleways. I just had
          to find out when and where I could do that, which is where the
          National Rail route map comes in:

            An insight into my definitely organised mind: what I sketched to see
            which trains I could use on my journey if I needed to. Blue is the
            bike route, with green the trains that could be used as shortcuts.

          I ended up doing a completely different route which goes off both the
          top <em>and</em> bottom of that map, but it planted the seed that
          trains were only here to help.

          If we look back at the route I finally did, I ended up on national
          cycle routes for <em>the whole thing</em>.

          This ended up meaning that some days I was biking not towards
          Cambridge at all, which - if I were only biking - would usually mean
          zero progress towards the end. But not so bad here! It&#39;s easily
          fixable with a train or two.

        <h2 id="conclusion-and-what">Conclusion (&quot;And what?&quot;)</h2>
        <p>
          To me, my journey counts as a bike tour. I will also say: bike touring
          is fun! You have one thing to do: bike. Go forwards. Head empty. Eat
          snack. Pedal.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also, let&#39;s not be purist. Trains make it so much better. You can
          pick and choose the best bike routes, all while retaining the feeling
          of slow progress towards your destination.
