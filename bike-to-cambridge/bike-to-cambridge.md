Recently, I biked from Birmingham to Cambridge.

More accurately, I half-biked, half-trained from Birmingham to Cambridge.
If it sounds more impressive, I "biked the distance from Birmingham to Cambridge".

Look ma! I did most of it with my own legs!

## Technicalities - how far *did* I bike?

If I were a crow, it would be a nice life. I would also get to Cambridge in 148 km, with stopovers.
