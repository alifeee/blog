# GPX data

## Bike routes

These are obtained from OS maps. They were originally recorded as 'activities', but were transitioned to 'routes', so they could be exported as GPX. This meant that they lost the information about time taken.

## Train routes

These are obtained from BRouter. For example, here is Stratford-upon-Avon to Leamington Spa:
