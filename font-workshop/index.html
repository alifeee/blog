          I ran a computer font-making workshop!
        </h1>

        <p>
          This week I ran a computer font-making workshop at my local hackspace.
          It was a bunch of fun, and I really enjoyed seeing the creativity come
          out of people via the medium of creating typefaces :)
        </p>
        <h2 id="why">Why?</h2>
        <p><a href="../making-bogface/">I like fonts</a></p>
        <h2 id="who-where-when">Who, Where, When?</h2>
        <p>
          I ran the workshop at my local hackspace. I&#39;d seen that they had
          run workshops before on knife-making and other things, and I thought
          it would be neat if I did something similarly collective. Often,
          people are together at the hackspace, which I
          <a href="../what-is-a-third-space/">enjoy in and of itself</a>. But,
          it is extra neat if people can be together and all be working on
          similar things.
        </p>
        <p>
          About three or four weeks ago, I decided to just &quot;do it&quot;,
          and I made up a sign and put it up at the hackspace.
        </p>
        <p>

        <figcaption>
          <p>
            Some have pointed out an irony that a poster for a computer font
            workshop was handwritten...
          </p>
        </figcaption>

        <p>
          As far as I was concerned, &quot;a workshop&quot; was not really an
          established idea. But that&#39;s part of the reason I like community
          spaces like the hackspace: I can pretend something is an established
          idea and people will believe it is.
        </p>
        <p>
          I didn&#39;t start with a great plan, but rather started by motivating
          myself to create a plan (by putting up the poster). This turned out to
          be a nice method of motivation, as I had set a date for my
          &quot;workshop&quot;, which forced me to consider what a
          &quot;workshop&quot; would involve.
        </p>
        <h2 id="what-does-a-workshop-involve">What does a workshop involve?</h2>
        <p>
          I ended up giving a short presentation about why I like fonts, some
          things to think about when designing a font, and an overview of how to
          use FontForge, which is the program
          <a href="../making-bogface/">that I made BogFace in</a>.
        </p>
        <h3 id="the-presentation">The presentation</h3>
        <p>
          I thought about using Google Slides to make a presentation. However,
          you can&#39;t use custom fonts, which was... kind of a killer for a
          font workshop.
        </p>
        <p>
          I went with <a href="https://revealjs.com/">RevealJS</a>, which I had
          seen one of my computer-loving lecturers use at university. It&#39;s
          quite neat to use, mainly because everything is written in HTML. I
          guess I am fate-bound to never use a WYSIWYG editor again.
        </p>
        <p>
          The presentation is hosted at
          <a href="https://alifeee.co.uk/font-workshop/"
            >https://alifeee.co.uk/font-workshop/</a
          >, but since it is a website, I can also embed it here! Have a scuttle
          around (press space to <del>slow down</del> progress.)

        ></iframe>

        <figcaption>
          <p>
            If I do another workshop in the future, I will probably update this
            a bit, and this embed would change :)

        <h2 id="what-people-made">What people made</h2>
        <p>
          I helped five people make their own fonts. Each one went about it
          quite (or slightly, depending on how much you care about fonts)
          differently.
        </p>
        <p>
          No method was wrong. Some methods were slower, fostering - I think -
          more appreciation for digital graphic work. All methods were very
          creative, and it was great to see different ways people went about
          making a font.
        </p>
        <p>
          Described briefly, and each description written in their own font,
          here are the ways people created their fonts:
        </p>
        <p>(Some are incomplete. Some will be updated as time passes.)</p>
        <div class="font--classic-neil">
          <h3 id="auto-traced-handwriting">Auto-traced handwriting</h3>
          <p>
            Tanya<a href="#footnotes">ยน</a> did what many designate the
            &quot;classic move&quot; in font-making: they made a handwriting
            font.
          </p>
          <p>
            The method was to draw the letters a through z on paper and take a
            picture of it. Then, each letter was isolated into a bitmap image of
            each letter.
            <a href="https://potrace.sourceforge.net/">potrace</a> was used to
            convert the bitmap images into SVG images, which were then imported
            into FontForge, where they could be resized and moved around to look
            good.
          </p>

        <div class="font--font">
          <h3 id="manually-traced-hand-designed-letters">
            Manually traced hand-designed letters
          </h3>
          <p>
            Ivanka<a href="#footnotes">ยน</a> drew some guidelines on paper, and
            designed and drew block letters on the sheet. Then, they took a
            picture of the hand-drawn letters and digitised them manually, using
            the vector tools in FontForge.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="font--vmorse">
          <h3 id="designed-a-morse-code-font">Designed a Morse code font</h3>
          <p>
            Dragomir<a href="#footnotes">ยน</a> designed a Morse font. You are
            reading it now.
          </p>

          <h3 id="digitally-designed-letter-forms">
            Digitally designed letter forms
          </h3>
          <p>
            Katya<a href="#footnotes">ยน</a> designed their letter forms entirely
            digitally, within FontForge. After a few, they were able to copy
            stylistic parts of letters to other letters, such as the caps of
            &quot;b&quot; and &quot;d&quot;.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="font--ricardo">

            Stroke-expanded lines drawn via touchscreen
          </h3>
          <p>
            Tomislav<a href="#footnotes">ยน</a> used their touchscreen laptop to
            draw the letters with a single stroke, and then used FontForge&#39;s
            <a href="https://fontforge.org/docs/techref/stroke.html"
              >&quot;Expand Stroke&quot;</a
            >
            to turn the one-dimensional drawings into two-dimensional vector
            shapes.

        <p>
          I had a lot of fun helping people make fonts, through thinking about
          design to how to practically using tools. It was very interesting and
          cool to me that each person involved made their font differently.
        </p>
        <p>
          In terms of how I ran it, and my presentation, I have some ideas of
          how to make things clearer and easier to understand.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was very fun to do, and I&#39;d love to run another font workshop!
