        <p>Time for a lightning round of the 5 Ws</p>
        <h2 id="who-is-this-relevant-to">Who (is this relevant to)?</h2>
        <p>
          Everyone! I encourage everyone I know to think about and visit third
          spaces. I believe they provide an experience valuable to everyone.
        </p>
        <h2 id="what-is-a-third-space">What (is a third space)?</h2>
        <p>To me, a third space is:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>a place that is not your work or your home</li>
          <li>
            and a place which you can visit semi-regularly, and have repeated
            interactions and chats with the same people, without planning to
            meet with them beforehand
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If you text friends/colleagues/acquaintances, and then go to a place
          to meet them, it is not a third space in my view. This is just a group
          of people meeting together, as an activity. A third space is somewhere
          people meet by chance, and somewhere that people are comfortable going
          to alone, because they know that people will be there who they can
          socialise with and chat to.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have tried to keep this definition broad, to include many places. In
          my personal opinion, some third spaces are better than others,
          &quot;better&quot; here meaning more socially &quot;good&quot;.
          &quot;Good&quot; here meaning &quot;good&quot;<a href="#footnotes"
            >¹</a
          >.
        </p>
        <h2 id="why-do-they-exist">Why (do they exist)?</h2>
        <p>
          Humans are social creatures<a href="#footnotes">²</a>. Third spaces
          are places that people <em>choose</em> to go exist in, and to
          socialise in, unlike the more forced nature of socialising at work, or
          even at home. There is a level of intentionalness about going to a
          third space which renders them different to &quot;the first&quot;
          (home) or &quot;second&quot; (work) places.
        </p>
        <h2 id="when-do-they-exist">When (do they exist)?</h2>
        <p>
          Okay, this is a strange W, but, I have twisted it into: third spaces
          have always existed, and I think people in &quot;modern&quot; society
          should be more aware of them as a social good, especially as the
          Internet and modern post-capitalism have trended younger generations
          towards a more... isolated lifestyle. In this way I also think that
          they should flourish and their existence grow.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my experience, a lot of people disregard third spaces as
          unimportant because they feel they lack the time outside of work and
          domesticity to be able to just &quot;hang around&quot; somewhere,
          without being <em>productive</em> with what little time they have left
          of the week. I think this is a bad thing, and that everyone should
          have more time (that fact alone is worth another entire blog post) to
          slow down and enjoy a third space.
        </p>
        <h2 id="where-are-they">Where (are they)?</h2>
        <p>
          Perhaps the most important W! Here I will list some places I consider
          to be third spaces, along with whether I consider them to be
          &quot;good&quot; third spaces (or, &quot;good examples&quot;) and why.
        </p>
        <h3 id="what-makes-a-rubbish-third-space">
          What makes a rubbish third space?
        </h3>
        <p>
          In order to not repeat myself, I introduce a few common reasons that a
          third place might be a bit rubbish
        </p>
        <h4 id="bad-time-based-availability">Bad time-based availability</h4>
        <p>
          Basically, this is the freedom to come and go on your own schedule. If
          a space is only accessible once a fortnight or once a month, then I
          think the time-based availability is bad. If you &quot;miss&quot;
          going to a third space, and that means you will have to wait a few
          weeks before being able to go again, the time-based accessibility is
          bad.
        </p>
        <p>
          I think a good space strives to be open as often as possible. However,
          being available too often may come with other drawbacks, such as a
          necessity to spend money.
        </p>
        <h4 id="bad-financial-accessibility">Bad financial accessibility</h4>
        <p>
          If you have to pay every time you visit a third space, or if it
          requires some kind of membership fee, it has bas financial
          accessibility.
        </p>
        <h4 id="bad-social-accessibility">Bad social accessibility</h4>
        <p>
          If you turn up to a space and people are not welcoming then it has bad
          social accessibility. This can be because the space is considered for
          a certain &quot;type of person&quot; by the people who attend it
          (think
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_members%27_club"
            >Gentlemen&#39;s Club</a
          >), or just because lots of people use the space only for pre-agreed
          meetings with friends, so are not turned on to the idea of talking to,
          or socialising with, strangers (think cafés, board game cafés, pool
          halls).
        </p>
        <h4 id="task-based-activities">Task-based activities</h4>
        <p>
          Some social spaces only exist because everybody there has a task in
          common that requires they meet at the space. I personally do not
          consider these proper accessible third spaces.
        </p>
        <h3 id="list-of-third-spaces">List of third spaces!</h3>
        <p>
          In no particular order, here is my (and
          <a href="https://alifeee.co.uk/i-am-having-a-good-blow-at-cheltenham/"
            >Robyn</a
          >&#39;s) list of third spaces. Each space has a clarification of what
          problems it may have to limit its goodness as a third space. These are
          theoretical based on our assumptions of a presumed average space of
          each type.

              This is

                >my favourite</a

              third space to visit. Some hackspaces have bad time-based
              availability (are only open for social nights once a
              week/infrequently). They could also be socially daunting to people
              who may not consider themselves &#39;specialised&#39; enough to
              attend. If this is you: maybe

            <p>Community garden</p>
            <p>
              Community gardens are fun! The time-based availability could be
              less-than-optimal, and the same with the weather.

          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Community café</p>
            <p>
              I have specifically said &quot;community café&quot; here, as I
              believe most cafés are not third spaces, but places people go
              (sometimes in groups) to buy drinks and food. However, I do think
              some cafés foster more of a sense of community and socialisation,
              so I include them here with the quite-arbitrary adjective of
              &quot;community&quot;. One issue here is a potential bad financial
              accessibility, which is a problem brought by the capitalistic need
              to purchase.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Barbershop/hair stylist</p>
            <p>
              I think people get a lot of social time out of hair
              establishments. I think they are similar to cafés, and have
              similar problems of financial accessibility.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Gym</p>
            <p>
              I prefer to bike, but I know some people consider gyms great third
              spaces. Again, however, I believe there is often a financial
              accessibility issue.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Members club</p>
            <p>
              Fun idea. Could be quite socially exclusionary and have financial
              accessibility issues.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Pool hall</p>
            <p>
              An example I often use. However, could be socially daunting or
              socially exclusionary, especially if the people there are there to
              play their <em>own</em> games of pool with their
              <em>own</em> friends, and not necessarily speak to
              <em>strangers</em>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Board game café</p>
            <p>
              Another place after my own heart, although time-based availability
              is often poor. That is to say that most of the time they are not
              social places, but instead only offer social evenings once or
              twice a month.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Religious groups</p>
            <p>
              This is a broad category and includes things organised by people
              who attend places of worship, but the activities to be thought of
              here are not specifically worship. Again, time-based availability
              is perhaps not great, and potentially socially exclusionary.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Sports clubs</p>
            <p>
              For example, tennis clubs, golf clubs, badminton clubs, climbing
              gyms. I think these have quite a large range of accessibility,
              thrice socially, physically, and fiscally.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Dog park</p>
            <p>
              I think this is an interesting example, but one I consider
              &quot;task based&quot;, as people only turn up here who have a dog
              to walk, so not overly accessible.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>School playground</p>
            <p>
              Ditto to the above, but &quot;dog to walk&quot; → &quot;child to
              walk&quot;.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Laundrette</p>
            <p>
              Also ditto to the above, but &quot;dog to walk&quot; →
              &quot;garment to walk&quot;.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I think that any place has the potential to be a great third space,
          for anyone! I think that there are a few common reasons holding some
          places back, or holding some people back (me) from thinking they are
          the best examples of third spaces that they want to provide to
          represent and explain the idea.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is also not an exhaustive list! If you have any other ideas, do
          comment or text me.

          How (can I go to a third space)?
        </h2>
        <p>
          If any of the spaces above or in the links below interest you, try and
          find the one nearest you! Or, ask me about it and I will give you my
          opinion as someone who has repeatedly had to find third places because
          of my frequent moving between cities.
        </p>
        <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          I love third spaces. I also love &quot;free spaces&quot;, which is a
          different concept for another time that I desire my society to have
          more of.
        </p>
        <p>
          My definition of third spaces, I think, differs slightly from the
          general definition of a &quot;third place&quot;, as I tend to place
          more importance on the social aspect, and opportunity to socialise and
          chat to people you may not know, or would not have otherwise. This may
          also be why I enjoy hitchhiking<a href="#footnotes">³</a>.
