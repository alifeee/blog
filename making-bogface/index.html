        <p>
          I think design is fascinating, and I have read a few books about
          fonts. One is
          <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/25658538"
            >Why Fonts Matter</a
          >,
        </p>
        <a
          class="why-fonts-matter hover-area"
          href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/25658538"
        >
          <div class="zine back"></div>
          <div class="zine front"></div>
        </a>

        <p>
          which posed a fun experiment of asking &quot;how many different fonts
          am I exposed to in an hour?&quot;. I often remember this, and look
          around, and it&#39;s often <em>a lot</em> of fonts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another book, which I still own, is
          <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26246257-script-fonts"
            >Script Fonts</a
          >,

        >
          <div class="zine back"></div>
          <div class="zine front"></div>
        </a>

        <p>
          which is simply a list of many fonts. The fonts are put into
          collections and each has a brief preface, but otherwise the book is...
          just fonts. Plain and simple. It even comes with a CD containing all
          the fonts! I don&#39;t have a CD drive.

          I think using non-default fonts on websites is always fun, and I
          recently started straying away from the fonts on Google Fonts and
          similar sites. This was part of my broader departure from the
          advertiser-filled, SEO-optimised, tracking-fueled Internet to the
          cooler, calmer, and altogether more personable
          <a href="https://indieweb.org/">IndieWeb</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          I enjoy
          <a href="https://alifeee.co.uk/bookmarks/">many personal websites</a>,
          and I knew of two that specifically had fonts:
          <a href="http://fonts.tom7.com/">Tom7&#39;s fonts</a> (a website I
          discovered via
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@tom7">Tom7&#39;s YouTube channel</a
          >),

          <a href="http://clofont.free.fr/">Des polices de caracteres a Gogo</a>
          (I found this site, a French website, mostly in French, with

            >Robyn</a

          Tom7&#39;s site has two pages of fonts, with maybe 30 fonts total. The
          second French site I have not yet found the bottom of, and has
          seemingly hundreds and maybe thousands of fonts. Over a few weeks, I
          found myself making
          <a href="https://webring.alifeee.co.uk/">one</a> or
          <a href="https://github.com/alifeee/invoice_template/">two</a> things,
          and when I thought &quot;I should pick a font for this&quot;, the
          natural choice was to use one from one of these personal sites. So,
          that&#39;s what I did!

        <h3 id="picking-a-tool-to-use">Picking a tool to use</h3>
        <p>
          After that, fonts were on the mind, so I decided to learn how to make
          them.
          <a href="http://fonts.tom7.com/faq.html">Tom7&#39;s font FAQ</a>
          (seemingly written over 20 years ago) suggested that making a font
          might be quite inaccessible, requiring expensive, bespoke software.

          However, I googled around (using my all-too-common method of
          prepending the phrase &quot;FLOSS open-source&quot; to whatever
          premium experience I was after) and found
          <a href="https://fontforge.org/en-US/">FontForge</a> and
          <a href="https://birdfont.org/">Birdfont</a>. I decided I would use
          the former, FontForge, as it seemed more mature (whatever that means).

          With not much to do, I spent the better half of a Boneless Wednesday<a
            href="#footnotes"
            >¹</a
          >
          reading the
          <a href="https://fontforge.org/en-US/documentation/"
            >FontForge documentation</a
          >. As well as teaching you how to use FontForge itself, there was a
          lot of information about how typefaces in general are rendered by
          computers, and the differences for different writing systems like
          Arabic and Mandarin. It is interesting stuff, especially if you&#39;re
          into typography (I have not decided whether I am or not, but evidence
          would sway me towards being).
        </p>
        <h3 id="making-a-typeface">Making a typeface</h3>
        <p>
          I started by making hand-painted letters into part of a font with the
          <a href="https://github.com/alifeee/kiran-builder-typeface"
            >Kiran Builder Typeface</a
          >
          (currently incomplete), a font based on a painted garage in East
          London. With that small project I developed a process for turning
          images of hand-drawn letter forms into vector graphics, which is the
          graphics format used for fonts. I will lay that process out here.
        </p>
        <h4 id="converting-hand-drawn-images-into-two-colour-bitmaps">
          Converting hand-drawn images into two-colour bitmaps
        </h4>
        <p>
          Fonts are single-colour, and then can be painted afterwards. So, to
          get from an image to vector graphics, I first converted the image to a
          2-color bitmap. For this I used
          <a href="https://www.getpaint.net/">Paint.Net</a> (the program I use
          for all raster image editing - think a more powerful MS Paint), and
          used <code>Effects&gt;Colour&gt;Quantize</code> to turn my photos into
          black-and-white PNGs (a simplified story. The extra steps were
          cleaning up things like the lines from the lined paper I used and
          other pen-marks.)

          Then, I cropped each symbol into its own file, so that I could import

          I was sure I read a thing in the documentation about importing an
          entire folder of files (&quot;a.png&quot;, &quot;b.png&quot;,
          &quot;c.png&quot;, ...) in one go, but I couldn&#39;t re-find it (the
          problem with reading documentation I guess?), so I just used the arrow
          keys to go from letter to letter and <code>CTRL+SHIFT+I</code> to
          import an image into each one.

        <h3 id="drawing-round-the-designs">Drawing round the designs</h3>
        <p>Then, I started manually tracing the images with Bézier curves.</p>
        <p>
          <img
            src="images/fontforge_beziering_b.png"
            alt="Screenshot of the FontForge editor with the letter B, traced"

            Look how neatly those Bézier points are placed around that letter.
            Mmm.
          </p>
        </figcaption>

        <p>
          This took a while. After around 10 letters, I started using
          <a href="https://potrace.sourceforge.net/"><code>potrace</code></a>
          via the FontForge UI to automagically trace round my letters. Then, I
          found a FontForge command called simply <code>simplify</code> which
          removed most of the Bézier points, giving the final letter a cleaner
          look. In the end, this process amounted to repeatedly pressing
          <code>CTRL+SHIFT+T</code> (autotrace),
          <code>CTRL+SHIFT+M</code> (simplify), <code>CTRL+M</code> a bunch
          (removing points), and then <code>CTRL+[</code> (go to next
          character).

        </p>
        <figcaption>
          <p>
            This one looks a lot more scruffy. But it did only take about 20
            seconds to make.
          </p>
        </figcaption>

        <p>This worked fine for me for two reasons:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            I was just tracing a hand-drawn font, rather than designing a font
            on a PC. This would involve a lot more fiddling around.
          </li>
          <li>
            I did not care about consistent letter sizes/thicknesses/widths.
            This would involve a lot more fiddling around.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="why-did-i-call-it-bogface">Why did I call it BogFace?</h3>
        <p>
          When I started doing lowercase letters, I had to decide a few things:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>the height of small letters (i.e., o, e, r, etc.)</li>
          <li>the height of &quot;ascenders&quot; (i.e., h, b, l)</li>
          <li>
            the &quot;height&quot; of &quot;descenders&quot; (i.e.,
            &quot;y&quot;)
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I pulled in three letters to my font-window to decide this: o, g, and
          b. Since I was doing this at the
          <a href="https://blog.alifeee.co.uk/hackspace-adventures/"
            >hackspace</a
          >
          (I was working on it on-and-off over a few days), someone leaned over
          and read out the three large letters on my screen, which I was too
          busy thinking about ascenders and descenders to parse.
        </p>
        <p>&quot;<strong>bog?</strong>&quot;, they inquired.</p>
        <p>&quot;yes&quot;, I replied.</p>
        <p>
          <img src="images/bog_metrics_window.png" alt="Screenshot of the
          FontForge metrics window, with "bog" written">

        <figcaption>
          <p>bog.</p>
        </figcaption>

        <p>
          This, combined with the facts that &quot;I thought the font looked a
          little boggy&quot;, and &quot;I fell in a bog on a
          <a href="https://alifeee.co.uk/scotland-trip/">trip to Scotland</a>
          this summer&quot; solidified what I was going to call my
          as-yet-unnamed typeface: <span class="BogFace">BogFace</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          (I only check this as of writing (if you want to make something:
          don&#39;t google it to check if it exists - just make it), but it
          <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%22bogface%22+font"
            >seems like</a
          >
          there was not already a typeface on the Internet called the same.)
        </p>

        <p>
          Eventually, I made all 26 Latin uppercase and lowercase letters. I
          also made some symbols.

        <h3 id="adding-more-things">Adding more things</h3>
        <p>
          After using BogFace for a bit (including a period of
          <a href="./images/wikipedia_bogged.png"
            >turning every website to use BogFace by default</a
          >), I realised that I wanted numbers, and also that the font looked
          smaller than normal. This second point was caused by me having a large
          descender size. Apparently, hand drawn letters naturally have massive
          descenders, and fonts do not,
        </p>
        <p>
          <img src="images/bogface_vs_arial.png" alt="Screenshot of "bog" and
          "bog", the first in BogFace, and the second in Arial. The BogFace g
          extends much further than the Arial.">
        </p>
        <figcaption>
          <p>
            See how much lower my hand-drawn g descends, compared to a g from a
            standard font like Arial.
          </p>
        </figcaption>

        <p>
          ...so in accommodating my massive descenders, I have made the overall
          font smaller. This is because there is no way to specify the height of
          a font (from the &quot;bottom&quot; of a letter to the top). Programs
          which draw fonts just decide the line-height is the bottom to the top,
          including the descender. This meant that for BogFace, the normal
          letters were small because of the extended descender.
        </p>
        <p>
          <img src="images/bogface_shrinkened.png" alt="Screenshot of "bog" and
          "bog" in BogFace and Arial. Now, they are shrunk to be the same
          size.">
        </p>
        <figcaption>
          <p>
            When you shrink BogFace to be the same size as a normal font, the
            extended g&#39;s make it look a lot smaller than a normal font.
            It&#39;s especially noticeable at smaller font sizes.
          </p>
        </figcaption>

        <p>
          So, I lowered the descender height of the font, and to stop the
          <em>loooong</em> letters having a fight with letters on the line
          below, also made them shorter graphically.
        </p>

          <img src="images/bogface_vs_bogface_less_descent.png" alt="Screenshot
          of "bog" and "bog", now both in BogFace. In the latter, the g descends
          less far.">
        </p>
        <figcaption>
          <p>
            This change technically reduces the &quot;authenticity&quot; of the
            font, but a) who was counting, and b) I drew the letters first-try
            with no design direction anyway.
          </p>
        </figcaption>

          That was it! I tagged it as
          <a href="https://github.com/alifeee/bogface/releases/tag/v1.0.0"
            >&quot;release 1.0.0&quot;</a
          >, and if I play with making fonts again, it will be on a new font!
        </p>
        <p>It&#39;s fun to have my own font.</p>
        <p>
          After I while (believe it or not), I got tired of having to read every
          website in BogFace. However, I left it as the default font, but still
          allowed sites to override it. That means that most of the time, I see
          sites how they were designed. However, sometimes sites leave certain
          sections unstyled, intentional or not, so every day I get to play an
          Easter egg hunt to find BogFace on the Internet.
        </p>
        <p>
          <img
            src="images/internet_bogface_easter_eggs.png"

        </p>
        <figcaption>
          <p>
            Some places I&#39;ve come across my own font in the wild include
            RightMove and random other websites.
          </p>
        </figcaption>

        <p>
          It&#39;s also nice to be able to know that if I need a whimsical
          typeface, I have one at my fingertips (for example for an
          <a href="https://liputenpo.alifeee.co.uk/">online newsletter</a>
          written entirely in
          <a href="https://tokipona.org/">toki pona</a> (link probably broken))
        </p>
        <p>
          I have not spoken about kerning. It is and was an entire ordeal. I
          hope you enjoy dealing with it if you choose to make a font.
        </p>
        <p>
          I will probably make more fonts. If I do make another font, I would
          like to spend more time designing it, and spend a bit more effort on
          it beyond &quot;trace a hand-drawn image&quot;.
