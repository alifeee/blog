# Moratorium of a book club

For a short time I ran a book club with my friends. After a couple of years, I stopped being so active in organising the meeting, and as such, the book club slowed and stopped.

This is fine, all things pass. More importantly, this was during an era where I loved writing stuff down. So, I ended up with several *facts* and *statistics*. Here they are.

1. [The data](#the-data)
   1. [Books](#books)
   2. [Meetings](#meetings)
   3. [Reading list](#reading-list)
2. [We read 14 books](#we-read-14-books)

## The data

First, the data. I was keeping track of stuff using [Notion](https://www.notion.com/), with all sorts of funky database structures. They were not worth the hassle. I now use [Obsidian](https://blog.alifeee.co.uk/notes/tagged/obsidian/).

### Books

First, a table of the books that we read, from [`books.csv`](./books.csv). It has the books, the reading date, and a review score if the person gave it one. Each book has about 4 or 5 reviews, meaning about 4 or 5 people read (some of) it or turned up to a book club and rated it from the Wikipedia summary.

I made the markdown for this from the CSV using a command, which prints the CSV as a TSV (Tab-Separated Values), and then replaces tabs with pipes `|`, and then adds the second row which is needed by markdown.

```bash
cols=$(csvtool width books.csv)
cat books.csv | csvtool paste -u TAB - | sed 's/\t/ | /g' | sed 's/^/| /' | sed 's/$/ |/' | awk 'NR==2 { for (i=1;i<='"${cols}"';i++) {printf "| --- "}; print " |" } {print}'
```

### Reading list

From [`book_suggestions.csv`](./book_suggestions.csv). Mostly, we would take the next book to read off of this list. Sometimes, it would come from thin air.

As you can see, this is somewhat of "alifeee's personal reading list", as I had suggested a lot of titles. My new "I want to read this" book list lies offline, on my Obsidian, but you can see a snapshot [here](./to_read_2025-01-20.txt). Other people suggested some other things, they are labelled the same as in the above books table.
