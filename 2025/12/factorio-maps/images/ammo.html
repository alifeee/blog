  This is my favourite area in the map because at the end, you can see the ammo
  factory is fed by two sources of iron. One comes from the left of the screen
  and ends up on the right of the ammo factory. The other comes from the right
  and ends on the left.

  In some way I think that is a great descriptor of the chaos of multiplayer,
  that two completely independent iron feeds end up feeding opposite ends of the
  same factory.
