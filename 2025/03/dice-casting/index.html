          This month Alex taught three of us how to make silicone moulds, mix
          resin, and make our own dice!

        <p>
          Alex has been trying out casting techniques for dice for a while on
          his own, and shared his knowledge with us by organising a hands-on
          workshop where we could try it out.

        <p>The process went like:</p>

        </ol>

        <h2>Day 1 - making moulds</h2>
        <p>
          The moulding process started with making a silicone mould of an
          existing dice. We chose to use dice from our personal collections, but
          just as easily could have used a 3D printed blank. This mould needs
          somewhere to pour the resin eventually, so we attached
          &quot;sprues&quot; to our dice which – when taken out – would form the
          negative space of a funnel.
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img
            src="./images/sprues.webp"
            alt="picture of several dice inside small yoghurt pots"
          />
          <figcaption>

            petit-filous yoghurt pot.

        </figure>

        <p>
          Then, we mixed together silicone by mixing equal-mass &quot;Part
          A&quot; and &quot;Part B&quot;. Once mixed, we each had 8 minutes to
          make all of our moulds.
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img
            src="./images/mixing-silicone.webp"
            alt="picture of person pouring out silicon mixture"

          <figcaption>

          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          At the end of our busy 8 minutes, we all placed our moulds in the
          pressure pot, which ensured that the silicone was as free of bubbles
          as possible while it cured.
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img
            src="./images/pressure-pot.webp"
            alt="picture of person putting lid on pressure pot"
          />
          <figcaption>

            several bar.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          Silicone should take a couple of hours to set, but the space
          wasn&#39;t quite room temperature, extending the wait time. We decided
          to leave and come back in two days.
        </p>
        <hr />

        <h2>Day 2 - mixing resin</h2>
        <p>
          With our time waiting for silicone to cure, we played around with
          mixing resin, using alcohol inks and mica powder to create translucent
          mixes. We put these in the pressure chamber with the moulds to test
          the colours.
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img
            src="./images/dyes-and-mica.webp"
            alt="picture of resin, alcohol inks, and mica powder"
          />
          <figcaption>

            resin mixed from both. I put too much ink in :S
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          We took the silicone moulds out of the pressure pot, and used a
          scalpel to cut three jagged lines from the top down. This allowed us
          to pry out the blanks (dice) and be left with empty silicone moulds.
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img
            src="./images/moulds.webp"
            alt="picture of several moulds on the table"
          />
          <figcaption>MJ's silicone moulds for a full set of dice.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          We each mixed our own resins, which thankfully gave us more time to
          work than the silicone (about 40 minutes).
        </p>
        <p>
          For my dice I went for a blend of half &quot;orange dye and blue mica
          powder&quot; and half &quot;blue dye and orange mica powder&quot;
          (attempting a split-look). For the D1 that I cast I went for
          &quot;pure purple&quot;.
        </p>

          <img
            src="./images/mixing-resin.webp"
            alt="picture of several people mixing or pouring resin"

        </figure>

        <p>
          Then, we all together put our filled moulds into the pressure pot,
          this time for at least 2 days to allow the resin to cure. Again, the
          pressure pot to reduce bubbles.
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img
            src="./images/pouring-resin.webp"
            alt="picture of person pouring resin"
          />
          <figcaption>

            quite viscous.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <hr />

        <h2>Day 3 - finishing</h2>
        <p>
          We came back to our dice after about a week, giving the resin plenty
          of time to set.
        </p>
        <p>
          We took the filled moulds out of the pressure pot, pryed apart the
          silicone, and got the resin objects out.
        </p>
        <p>
          The silicone moulds (and thus the resin) picks up extraordinary levels
          of detail from the original item. It also picks up the sprue (pouring
          funnel), so we had to snap those off, then cut and sand down where it
          was attached.
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img
            src="./images/many-dice.webp"
            alt="picture of several dice on the table without painted numbers"
          />
          <figcaption>
            Sanding "nubbins" off of all of these was a fair amount of effort.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          Finally, we painted the numbers on. Since the numbers were recessed,
          the easiest way to do this was to paint the entire face sloppily, then
          wipe off the paint from the surface, which leaves paint in the
          recessed number.
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img
            src="./images/painting-dice.webp"

            think the white looks nice.

        </figure>

        <p>I was very happy with the final dice.</p>
