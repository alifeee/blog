        <p>
          I spent this afternoon adding two diagonal support struts to minimise
          the wobble. It worked better than I thought it would!
        </p>
        <p>
          It was mostly a patch job – the bench isn&#39;t exactly high-quality –
          so they&#39;re not amazingly sized up (there is a big air gap):
        </p>
        <p>
          <img
            src="./images/bench6.webp"
            alt="picture of two pieces of wood attached to one another with a large gap where a screw is visible"
          />
        </p>
        <p>…but, it&#39;s stable enough for me!</p>
        <p>Putting it together involved:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>a lot of turning the bench upside-down</li>
          <li>
            finding a few completely rounded screws that I couldn&#39;t remove —
            instead I worked around them
          </li>
          <li>using a very blunt saw to cut the diagonal struts</li>
          <li>
            holding some things at some quite inconvenient angles (I could have
            well-used an assistant)
          </li>
          <li>
            breaking a couple of drill-bits (one because of its low-quality [it
            was from the middle-of-Aldi] and the other because of weird drilling
            angles due to the aforementioned completely rounded screw)
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>If I did it again, I&#39;d like to have:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>a better (sharper) saw</li>
          <li>measured up the struts better</li>
          <li>an assistant</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Here are some more pictures of the – to be honest, almost rotting –
          bench.
        </p>
        <figure class="gallery">
          <img
            src="./images/bench1.webp"
            alt="picture of upside-down bench with some screws in the bottom"
          />
          <img
            src="./images/bench2.webp"
            alt="zoomed picture of a bench with some screws in"
          />
          <img
            src="./images/bench5.webp"
            alt="picture of the underside of a bench showing two almost-attached support struts"
          />
        </figure>

        <p>
          The support struts are cut from another bench that I found discarded
          on the street and disassembled for wood. One man&#39;s trash.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, here&#39;s a nice SVG rendition of the bench (pre-struts). I
          traced it using Inkscape.
        </p>
        <p><img src="./bench.svg" alt="SVG drawing of garden bench" /></p>
        <p>
          I hope it can continue to keep me and my housemates comfortable eating
          our alfresco teas.
