<h1>Stabilising our wobbly bench</h1>
<p>Check out this wobbly bench:</p>

<p>I spent this afternoon adding two diagonal support struts to minimise the wobble. It worked better than I thought it would!</p>
<p>It was mostly a patch job – the bench isn&#39;t exactly high-quality – so they&#39;re not amazingly sized up (there is a big air gap):</p>
<p><img src="./images/bench6.webp" alt="picture of two pieces of wood attached to one another with a large gap where a screw is visible"></p>
<p>…but, it&#39;s stable enough for me!</p>
<p>Putting it together involved:</p>
<ul>
<li>a lot of turning the bench upside-down</li>
<li>finding a few completely rounded screws that I couldn&#39;t remove — instead I worked around them</li>
<li>using a very blunt saw to cut the diagonal struts</li>
<li>holding some things at some quite inconvenient angles (I could have well-used an assistant)</li>
<li>breaking a couple of drill-bits (one because of its low-quality [it was from the middle-of-Aldi] and the other because of weird drilling angles due to the aforementioned completely rounded screw)</li>
</ul>
<p>If I did it again, I&#39;d like to have:</p>
<ul>
<li>a better (sharper) saw</li>
<li>measured up the struts better</li>
<li>an assistant</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some more pictures of the – to be honest, almost rotting – bench.</p>

</figure>

<p>The support struts are cut from another bench that I found discarded on the street and disassembled for wood. One man&#39;s trash.</p>
<p>Finally, here&#39;s a nice SVG rendition of the bench (pre-struts). I traced it using Inkscape.</p>

<p>I hope it can continue to keep me and my housemates comfortable eating our alfresco teas.</p>
