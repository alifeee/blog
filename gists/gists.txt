# WHY I like gists

They're shareable, both to other people...

https://gist.github.com/alifeee/c857bfb45bfd260a9b9dd9c45e4f7478
https://gist.github.com/alifeee/75df204c2be3815806e1d4be47e54d08
https://gist.github.com/alifeee/829344ed02efb0952e81fc35c445df18

...and to my future self...

https://gist.github.com/alifeee/2f4be232f6b9c4b384f4c020a5bc10a1
https://gist.github.com/alifeee/2e1ea8ad5290a553316e715f658f1fd7
https://gist.github.com/alifeee/8342d9677c436e2353233f68f34cfe19

...and (much to GitHub's enjoyment) they're in the same place.

I make a lot of scripts and they would otherwise end up in a combination of:

- random repositories
- random folders on my computer

Gists make it easy to have them in one place.

## Secondly, other people's

types of gist
- data
- how-to
- blog posts

resume
this is neat but I don't really use it - bespoke became better
https://gist.github.com/alifeee/97f9ac1642b1c46cf66942c3f079a42f

VSCode extension list
when I set this up, you could export your extensions in a nicely formatted JSON
now you can't so this gist is pretty pointless
https://gist.github.com/alifeee/d46f1f41189b13bb44c2c32f84f69edc

Mumble server set up
this is nice. I can reuse it.
Why I came back to it? it taught me how to use `sudo service status ...`
https://gist.github.com/alifeee/2b8831d503438ff147fb8df6c01858c4

Web bookmarks
Not really used. Just thought it would be nice to have "open data" version of alifeee.co.uk/bookmarks
https://gist.github.com/alifeee/5d84396d0404a879bb41329ec5afa9d3

Nginx setup
Set up to replace Docker container running website on port 80 with nginx (flat files)
Again this one helped me understand services
I also set up things like subdomains (webring.alifeee.co.uk)
also I learnt how to do HTTP basic auth and have come back to it
also I learnt how to use Let's Encrypt and have come back to it
also it's a nice place to store my config if everything explodes (even if it means experts can know my exact config and find exploits...)
https://gist.github.com/alifeee/92defe5a02a2e1dd17cb517135e80ffe

Setup RSA keys
Writing this down has saved me many times.
I have been back to this one LOADS
for RSA keys for ssh and GitHub
before this I didn't really understand keys so I was copying my private key over oops. something being called "key" and "key.pub" didn't make me take enough of a look.
especially as I have a laptop, and a computer, and a server, and other servers I use git on
(and for some reason I set up SSH and GitHub on my phone for weeknotes)
also I often look back for the ssh config (much nicer to type "ssh server")
https://gist.github.com/alifeee/2f4be232f6b9c4b384f4c020a5bc10a1

Spotify Wrapped
I just learnt TOML and I liked it, so I wanted to manually encode something into TOML for fun
Spotify wrapped had just come out
https://gist.github.com/alifeee/075086b13fe5cec4c86d0f051973a960

toki pona words
more fun with awk
https://gist.github.com/alifeee/7afeac3587624d66d7b370fe23882252

transfer folders over scp
I later realise I can just scp with a glob *
but I have come back to this to remember the tar arguments
https://gist.github.com/alifeee/4a6cead6cd3e79a6620100ea00de5e42

FTP
I set this up so I could use https://foldersync.io/ to FTP to my server
I didn't end up using it
https://gist.github.com/alifeee/f11e7295659576c236869079a3105025

Factorio map
This took hours to set up initially
But every week after the game I could run through the commands quickly and without thinking
https://gist.github.com/alifeee/fb16acc9b4cc8b6d52e4f3226cc10197

Download Toggl data
this is a local script, but I put it on Gist to share it
jq is scary and I don't know how to use it
https://gist.github.com/alifeee/5ccfdff391f1bfc894f6e21beb78996d

How to blog
Created for one person
Shared to others
https://gist.github.com/alifeee/c857bfb45bfd260a9b9dd9c45e4f7478

Hat blog
Example for the above
https://gist.github.com/alifeee/48f83a302205772e1a911ac889ae6212

common RSS extensions
I was manually trying these on sites
I wrote them down so I can manually try all the ones I can think of
https://gist.github.com/alifeee/8342d9677c436e2353233f68f34cfe19

Run things as a service
systemd! finally I learnt how to use it
https://gist.github.com/alifeee/606ffd2cefaceeeff92a037e797e5458

combine RSS for SquareSpace
not really re-used, but hosted on server so thought I should put it somewhere
https://gist.github.com/alifeee/2eb9ac2296a698dc8a05d4ed531d8d36

gpl to css converter!
a script that I would want to find when googling, so maybe now people do
https://gist.github.com/alifeee/586b92e21f912dde7f74cd498b7cbb56

font to css converter
used this in multiple repositories, good to know it's somewhere and not go digging for it
https://gist.github.com/alifeee/8607c787a0c60684827b5f07bbb95a5d

bash graph making
I sometimes have data in bash.
making a graph in bash seems a terrible idea so I love it
https://gist.github.com/alifeee/2e1ea8ad5290a553316e715f658f1fd7

install ruby and jekyll
I found this confusing, so I wrote it down
I needed it again to install ruby somewhere else
https://gist.github.com/alifeee/829344ed02efb0952e81fc35c445df18

FFmpeg commands
haven't added any more but, "turn mp4 into gif" is a pretty standard thing (for physical electronics projects)
https://gist.github.com/alifeee/9e968dbf9f380ab4b15cda8d05d2a89e

naked.sh
for https://css-naked-day.github.io/
there were tools for WordPress, Perl, Django, Drupal, but not "just raw html"
https://gist.github.com/alifeee/75df204c2be3815806e1d4be47e54d08

bar chart
again with the data, I like to compare metrics sometimes
a bar chart is a nice way of doing so
https://gist.github.com/alifeee/a6f14aad9caed6b8a861df0e2850aa10
