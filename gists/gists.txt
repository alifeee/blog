# WHAT is a gist

It is just "some text on the Internet". Usually, people put either code or markdown in them. Sort of like pastebin, but more permanent.

They can be like blog posts, or they can be like a miniature GitHub repository for a commonly used script.

They can also be somewhere to (publically or privately) store data to be retrieved from elsewhere, like https://jsonresume.org/

Anyone with a GitHub account can make a gist. It is an easy way to share text.

This is not an endorsement of GitHub. You could make a non-GitHub gist on another website.

# WHY I like gists

They're shareable, both to other people...

https://gist.github.com/alifeee/75df204c2be3815806e1d4be47e54d08
https://gist.github.com/alifeee/829344ed02efb0952e81fc35c445df18

...and to my future self...

https://gist.github.com/alifeee/2f4be232f6b9c4b384f4c020a5bc10a1
https://gist.github.com/alifeee/2e1ea8ad5290a553316e715f658f1fd7
https://gist.github.com/alifeee/8342d9677c436e2353233f68f34cfe19

...and (much to GitHub's enjoyment) they're in the same place.

I make a lot of scripts and they would otherwise end up in a combination of:

- random repositories
- random folders on my computer

Gists make it easy to have them in one place.

## Secondly, other people's

I know other people do a similar thing as me, so I often add `"site:gist.github.com"` to web searches.

Yes, I know that not everyone likes GitHub, but I know that enough do that I will find what I want.
I do not have a better way to get through the search engine SEO garbage.
For example (surmise what I've been doing for the past several weeks)

types of gist
- data
- how-to
- blog posts

resume
this is neat but I don't really use it - bespoke became better
https://gist.github.com/alifeee/97f9ac1642b1c46cf66942c3f079a42f

VSCode extension list
when I set this up, you could export your extensions in a nicely formatted JSON
now you can't so this gist is pretty pointless
https://gist.github.com/alifeee/d46f1f41189b13bb44c2c32f84f69edc

Mumble server set up
this is nice. I can reuse it.
Why I came back to it? it taught me how to use `sudo service status ...`
https://gist.github.com/alifeee/2b8831d503438ff147fb8df6c01858c4

Web bookmarks
Not really used. Just thought it would be nice to have "open data" version of alifeee.co.uk/bookmarks
https://gist.github.com/alifeee/5d84396d0404a879bb41329ec5afa9d3

Nginx setup
Set up to replace Docker container running website on port 80 with nginx (flat files)
Again this one helped me understand services
I also set up things like subdomains (webring.alifeee.co.uk)
also I learnt how to do HTTP basic auth and have come back to it
also I learnt how to use Let's Encrypt and have come back to it
also it's a nice place to store my config if everything explodes (even if it means experts can know my exact config and find exploits...)
https://gist.github.com/alifeee/92defe5a02a2e1dd17cb517135e80ffe

Setup RSA keys
Writing this down has saved me many times.
I have been back to this one LOADS
for RSA keys for ssh and GitHub
before this I didn't really understand keys so I was copying my private key over oops. something being called "key" and "key.pub" didn't make me take enough of a look.
especially as I have a laptop, and a computer, and a server, and other servers I use git on
(and for some reason I set up SSH and GitHub on my phone for weeknotes)
also I often look back for the ssh config (much nicer to type "ssh server")
https://gist.github.com/alifeee/2f4be232f6b9c4b384f4c020a5bc10a1

Spotify Wrapped
I just learnt TOML and I liked it, so I wanted to manually encode something into TOML for fun
Spotify wrapped had just come out
https://gist.github.com/alifeee/075086b13fe5cec4c86d0f051973a960

toki pona words
more fun with awk
https://gist.github.com/alifeee/7afeac3587624d66d7b370fe23882252

transfer folders over scp
I later realise I can just scp with a glob *
but I have come back to this to remember the tar arguments
https://gist.github.com/alifeee/4a6cead6cd3e79a6620100ea00de5e42

FTP
I set this up so I could use https://foldersync.io/ to FTP to my server
I didn't end up using it
https://gist.github.com/alifeee/f11e7295659576c236869079a3105025

Factorio map
This took hours to set up initially
But every week after the game I could run through the commands quickly and without thinking
https://gist.github.com/alifeee/fb16acc9b4cc8b6d52e4f3226cc10197

Download Toggl data
this is a local script, but I put it on Gist to share it
jq is scary and I don't know how to use it
https://gist.github.com/alifeee/5ccfdff391f1bfc894f6e21beb78996d

How to blog
Created for one person
Shared to others
https://gist.github.com/alifeee/c857bfb45bfd260a9b9dd9c45e4f7478

Hat blog
Example for the above
https://gist.github.com/alifeee/48f83a302205772e1a911ac889ae6212

common RSS extensions
I was manually trying these on sites
I wrote them down so I can manually try all the ones I can think of
https://gist.github.com/alifeee/8342d9677c436e2353233f68f34cfe19

Run things as a service
systemd! finally I learnt how to use it
https://gist.github.com/alifeee/606ffd2cefaceeeff92a037e797e5458

combine RSS for SquareSpace
not really re-used, but hosted on server so thought I should put it somewhere
https://gist.github.com/alifeee/2eb9ac2296a698dc8a05d4ed531d8d36

gpl to css converter!
a script that I would want to find when googling, so maybe now people do
https://gist.github.com/alifeee/586b92e21f912dde7f74cd498b7cbb56

font to css converter
used this in multiple repositories, good to know it's somewhere and not go digging for it
https://gist.github.com/alifeee/8607c787a0c60684827b5f07bbb95a5d

bash graph making
I sometimes have data in bash.
making a graph in bash seems a terrible idea so I love it
https://gist.github.com/alifeee/2e1ea8ad5290a553316e715f658f1fd7

install ruby and jekyll
I found this confusing, so I wrote it down
I needed it again to install ruby somewhere else
https://gist.github.com/alifeee/829344ed02efb0952e81fc35c445df18

FFmpeg commands
haven't added any more but, "turn mp4 into gif" is a pretty standard thing (for physical electronics projects)
https://gist.github.com/alifeee/9e968dbf9f380ab4b15cda8d05d2a89e

naked.sh
for https://css-naked-day.github.io/
there were tools for WordPress, Perl, Django, Drupal, but not "just raw html"
https://gist.github.com/alifeee/75df204c2be3815806e1d4be47e54d08

bar chart
again with the data, I like to compare metrics sometimes
a bar chart is a nice way of doing so
https://gist.github.com/alifeee/a6f14aad9caed6b8a861df0e2850aa10
