          I did a
          <a href="https://alifeee.co.uk/durham_physics/"
            >Physics degree at Durham University</a
          >. This blog comes as a result of a party I had just before final year
          exams, after everyone had finished their final-year dissertations and
          reports.
        </p>
        <p>
          To celebrate that we&#39;d all spent half the year knee-deep inside a
          PDF, we had DICE (Dissertation Isdone Celebration Event)! As part of
          the party, I got people to write down a sentence or phrase from their
          dissertation, without context. We drew them out of a hat and made a
          game of guessing what the degree title was for each.
        </p>
        <p>
          Recently I was reminded of the party when I pulled what remained of
          the notes from the bottom of a deep drawer. I thought that it would be
          nice to digitise them, so they&#39;re viewable, as I think that
          it&#39;s quite artistic that each note represents a sort of
          &quot;summary&quot; of someone&#39;s entire degree.
        </p>
        <p>
          They were each numbered, but unfortunately, I didn&#39;t find the key
          which matched the number to the writer or degree title. But... that
          just means that <em>you</em> get to play the game of guessing what
          degree each belongs to!

            (p.s., after the
            <a href="../sketch-your-society/">previous post</a>, it seems as if
            I&#39;ve turned this blog into
            <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/foundpaper">found paper</a>. the
            next post won&#39;t be. maybe.)

        <h2 id="the-snippets">The snippets</h2>
        <p>
          The labelling suggests there were at least 15 snippets, but number 10
          is AWOL. Thus, here are only 14. To see the degree for each sentence,
          check the <a href="./answers.txt">answers</a> (these will be updated
          as I remember them or as the people who wrote them read this...)

            If the nugget is too large or too small, the overall predictive
            function will either be too sensitive to the random noise in the
            data, or will not take it into account at all.

            Unfortunately, during the testing, one of the participants (a male
            aged 18-24) had to stop the process after only a couple of minutes
            due to sickness, and therefore did not have change to generate any
            meaningful data for this project.

            A similar approach is taken when designing military aircraft in such
